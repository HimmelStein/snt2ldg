<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16 January, by Xu Xingtang, Qian Yuhong Dai Xianglong, President of the Chinese People's Bank, said that China would carry on finance open policy. </seg>

<seg id=3> On today's News Releasing Meeting for national and foreign journalists, Dai Xianglong emphasized that China would not give up finance open policy just because of the turbulent finance in some of the southeast Asian countries. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> He said that last year a group of foreign banks and insurance companies opened their branches in China. By the end of the year, there were about 170 financial business organizations of foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the coming years, we should properly increase the branches of foreign banks and insurance companies. Meanwhile, we planned to enlarge the pilot projects to let foreign bank agencies deal with Renminbi business. </seg>

<seg id=8> However, we should learn lessons from the financial crisis in Southeast Asia for our open capital projects and we should be more careful. </seg>
