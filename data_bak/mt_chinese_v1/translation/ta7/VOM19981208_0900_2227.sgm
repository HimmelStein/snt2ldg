<seg id=1> Leader of the Chinese Economy and Trade Committee Sheng Huaren expressed that Chinese army and other government departments would lose control of their subordinate enterprises in the coming few days. </seg>
<seg id=2> Although the Chinese government had made such instructions a couple of times before, the determination this time seemed greater. </seg>
<seg id=3> Now let's listen to the report by VOA reporter Ning Xin. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Leader of the Chinese Economy and Trade Committee Sheng Huaren expressed that the Chinese army would lose control of its subordinate enterprises before 20 December. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other departments of the Party, the government and the judicial departments must also take similar actions early next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> In order to control the increasing corruption and smuggling in the army, Chairman of State Jiang Zemin ordered in July that the army and the troops of military police stop running enterprises, hotels and the other businesses. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren addressed that so far, some subordinate enterprises of the army in Shanghai and Tianjin had been under control by the local governments, but he didn't state whether the army would get any compensation. </seg>
<seg id=8> Besides that the army must lose control of its subordinate enterprises, the Party, the government and the judicial departments were not allowed to run their subordinate state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=9> There are 100 million staff in the state-owned enterprises in China, many state-owned enterprises are at the edge of bankruptcy because of the serious flaws in their accounts and dead accounts, and the slump export market followed with the global economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said that now in many state-owned enterprises, the staff were 10 times higher than the actual staff required, which caused the enterprises the severe deficit last year. </seg>
<seg id=11> This showed that improving the market competitive abilities of the state-owned enterprises had become a pressing matter of the moment. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, analysts expressed that corruption and bad administration widely existed in the government departments and the judicial departments that took charge of the state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common situation was that many government officials who took charge of an industry ran an enterprise of the industry at the same time. </seg>
<seg id=14> Therefore, they could use their power to provide their enterprises with munificence in contracts, loans and taxes. </seg>
<seg id=15> This broke the fair competition of marketing, and prevented the Chinese economy from transforming from planned economy to market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> It's known that a new committee of the State Council would supervise 500 former subordinate enterprises of the Party, the government and the judicial departments, and the personnel department would arrange the staff of these enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=17> Local governments would supervise some small enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=18> In addition, finance and investment companies would be under the unified supervision of the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> So far, it had not been clear whether these changes meant that the country would reduce loans for the state-owned enterprises to let some of the big enterprises go into bankruptcy gradually by themselves. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts believed that China would solve the deficit problem of the state-owned enterprises mainly by the way of merger rather than bankruptcy since worrying about the social turbulence followed by the high rate of unemployment. </seg>
