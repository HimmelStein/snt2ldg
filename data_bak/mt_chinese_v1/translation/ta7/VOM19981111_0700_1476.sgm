<seg id=1> In Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, the representatives of the World Weather Conference of the United Nations were carrying on their work. </seg>
<seg id=2> At the same time, the American Congress was discussing whether to agree on the agreement of the Tokyo Conference in Japan last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to the report from Buenos Aires by Franks, reporter of the Voice of America, some Congressmen brought the dispute to the conference in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Senator of the Democratic Party of America Liegeman and Lick made a statement in Buenos Aires on Tuesday to urge the Clinton government to sign the agreement of the Tokyo Conference this week. </seg>
<seg id=6> Both of the senators expressed that this would enhance the persuasion of the American representatives, and make the developing countries more able to make promises on the issue of reducing the exhaustion of the greenhouse effect. </seg>
<seg id=7> This is actually the prerequisite of the proposals passed in the past by the Senate. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some of the House of Representatives of America in Buenos Aires said that they were against any such act by the Clinton government. </seg>
<seg id=9> Member of the House of Representatives and the Republic Party from Wisconsin, Chairman of the Committee On Science of the United States House of Representatives Sensenbrenner said that the Agreement of the Tokyo Conference had fatal shortcomings, and the Senate of the United States must vote it down. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> House of Representatives Sensenbrenner said that just as the agreement was being laid aside at the moment, the agreement had been dead before it was sent to the Senate. It's impossible for the Senate of the United States to approve the agreement. </seg>
<seg id=12> The question is that what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> We should discuss again about whether to try to save it or to announce the fatal shortcomings of the agreement. </seg>
<seg id=14> House of Representatives Sensenbrenner said that it's not the conflict between the two parties in the House of Representatives or in the Senate of the United States, and some of the famous Senators of the Democratic Party also agreed with him. </seg>
<seg id=15> House of Representatives of the Democratic Party from Pennsylvania Clink said that he was against the agreement because the agreement would reduce the employment and the level of American industrialization. </seg>

<seg id=17> He said that with the same determination, the Agreement of the Tokyo Conference would win. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> Cushing, House of Representatives, said that "I hope the process will carry on, and no matter whether the Congress of America will join it or not, we should not ignore the possibility to reach a global plan regardless of the obstinacy of Congressmen. </seg>
<seg id=20> In the conference hall in Buenos Aires, the representatives are discussing various problems, some of which will have to be left to the meeting of ministers of energy resources and environment from 160 nations on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id=21> The American representatives said that although what the American Congress concerned about was laid aside until the next conference, this conference was successful. </seg>
