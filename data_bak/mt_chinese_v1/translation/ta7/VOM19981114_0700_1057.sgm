<seg id=1> An American Military Control Delegation that left for Beijing to discuss China's joining in the agreement on missile technology control believed that China might still sell the missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Now lets listen to the comprehensive report by VOA reporter Fang Yuan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A group of American officials led by Acting secretary of State Colin Powell talked with Chinese Prime Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese Army Xiong Guangkai and other military control experts about China's joining in the agreement on missile technology control for a day and a half in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id=4> The meeting focused on how to carry out the promises made by Chinese Chairman of State Jiang Zemin when President Clinton visited China this June. </seg>
<seg id=5> At that time, Jiang Zemin expressed that China would consider joining in the Agreement on Missile Technology Control, and this would become one of the major achievements of the Sino-American Summit Conference. </seg>
<seg id=6> A member of the American delegation told the American News Service that America still doubted that China was not selling parts of missile or the technology, and that Pakistan and Iran were two beneficiaries of the Chinese missile technology. </seg>
<seg id=7> The official said that America continued raising questions, and he believed that China was taking some action to solve the problems. </seg>
<seg id=8> That China exports missile technology has frequently had a brush in the Sino-American relationship. </seg>
<seg id=9> After India and Pakistan, the old enemy states in the South Asian Subcontinent, conducted nuclear tests in the first half of the year, America felt it extremely necessary that China made promises on missile technology control, since Pakistan, a nuclear opponent in the South Asian Subcontinent, was one of China's long-term allies. </seg>
<seg id=10> Early in 1993, America applied economic sanctions against China because China sold missile parts and technology to Pakistan, and America didn't cancel the sanctions until China promised to stop selling earth-to-earth missiles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=11> America was still worried that the missile business between China and Iran would imperil the interest of America and its allied countries in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the official was not willing to explain what kind of missile technology that China provided to Pakistan and Iran, and when this technology was provided. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said that so far we hadn't had enough evidence to prove that China sold missile technology to the two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> Whenever America got some evidence that China had sold missile technology to the two countries, China always either denied or explained that the technology was dual-purpose, and the technology provided was for the purpose of peace. </seg>
<seg id=15> So far, China had not made any public response to the American delegation. </seg>
<seg id=16> Besides, according to the American News Service, Beijing, Washington had proved that it's not China but North Korea that helped Pakistan with the research and launched the Gaoli Missile this April. </seg>
