<seg id=4> Let's listen to a report from Toronto by VOA reporter Yan Ming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Canadian Minister of International Trade Pittigrew enthusiastically responded to the suggestion in a report from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Canadian Senate that trade should be linked with human rights. </seg>
<seg id=6> Pittigrew thought that Canada should add human rights as a new aspect to the policy of the Canadian foreign trade. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to the Ottawa Citizens Post, Canadian Minister of International Trade Pittigrew made the above statement on Thursday when he attended a meeting on foreign affairs and international trade in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id=8> Pittigrew said that not long ago what he heard when he attended the Summit Conference of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization in Malaysia, and the situation that the Chinese government arrested dissenters in these days, etc. made him firmly believe that no matter whether offering economic assistance or dealing with international trade, Canada should also export their own value concept while exporting the products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Human rights and social justice should become one of the important contents of Canadian foreign affairs policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> According to the Canadian News Agency, the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Canadian Senate suggested that the Canadian government reconsider the projects of foreign aid, try to improve the economic development of the recipient countries at the same time to improve the local human rights conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to the National Post, there were various indications that the Canadian government was trying to adjust the policy toward the Asian countries including China, and the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Canadian Senate was one of the signals. </seg>
<seg id=12> On Thursday, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs John Manley showed that Canada followed with interest that the Chinese government arrested dissenters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said that we must make some response to it. </seg>
<seg id=14> We had already showed the Chinese government that their way of arresting dissenters was against the International Treaty of Citizen's Rights and Political Rights made by the United Nations and signed by China. </seg>
<seg id=15> According to the Canadian News Agency, in fact, when Prime Minister of Canada Chretien visited China last month, he changed the attitude that they hadn't criticized China in public for about one to two years, and he criticized the Chinese records on human rights on some public occasions. </seg>
<seg id=16> Actually, what the Prime Minister did explained some changes in the Canadian foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> The National Post said that reactions of the Canadian businessmen varied towards Pittigrew's attitude that he supported linking trade to human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> Some worried in private that it would affect Canadian businesses. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, Dr Zhu Yuchao from the University of Old Hogem in British Columbia had a completely different idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> As far as the capital in North America was concerned, they invested in East Asia to build factories, and to do business. One of the important reasons was to earn money, and to be beneficial. </seg>
<seg id=21> While they went to the East Asian countries, they brought some criterion, such as laborer protection ideas, protecting the worker, protecting the worker's benefit, and the requirement of conditions, etc. to these countries. This was bilateral. </seg>
<seg id=22> And this, the person was a model. It's good for the local people to improve their human rights. Directly, on the rights of the workers, such a kind, it had a very direct influence. </seg>
