<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 1 September, by Zhang Youhao Art Eggleton, French Minister of National Defence, said that France was studying a plan to withdraw troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Art Eggleton made the above statement when he talked with a reporter in Paris. </seg>
<seg id=4> He pointed out that the American suggestion of lifting a ban on shipping weapons to Bosnia and Herzegovina meant that "the international support is over", and "serious open conflict will break out again", which could cause "a serious loss". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Art Eggleton said: "under the current situation the security of the peace-keeping troops of the United Nations cannot be guaranteed, we cannot accept lifting a ban on shipping weapons to Bosnia and Herzegovina". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine pointed out clearly that the prerequisite to lifting a ban on shipping weapons was that France withdrew the Blue Helmet Army, and the Peace-keeping Troops of the United Nations left there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since the conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina broke out in February 1992, France had sent about 4,000 army officers and men to Bosnia and Herzegovina. </seg>
<seg id=8> France is the western country that sent the most of the Blue Helmet Army to the area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> American President Clinton declared on 10 August that if the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina refused to accept the Five-Country Peace Plan by 15 October, he would ask the Security Council to pass a decision on lifting a ban on shipping weapons to Bosnia and Herzegovina. If the Security Council didn't act, he would ask America to lift the ban on shipping weapons to Bosnia and Herzegovina alone. </seg>
