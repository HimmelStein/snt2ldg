<seg id=3> Thailand Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Pham Quang Tuyen said that the Ministry of Transportation and the National Railway Department in Thailand had the rights to request the Hopewell Groups US$6800 million compensation for the delay of the project, and Thailand complained that the Hopewell Groups had only finished 12% of the planned project in the last 8 years. </seg>
