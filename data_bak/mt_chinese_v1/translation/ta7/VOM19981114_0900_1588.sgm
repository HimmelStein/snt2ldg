<seg id=1> In meteorological phenomena, we all know that the effect of the El Nino phenomenon caused the integrated fire in Indonesia, flood in the desert of Peru, and the serious unusual weather of the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> In America, earlier this year California and the southern states were attacked by flood, and then many places in the south haddrought. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to experts, the El Nino Phenomenon is now changing into a new phenomenon called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> And La Nina will show its power next year that will not be inferior to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Now let's listen to the report by VOA reporter Li Lan, broadcast by Qi zhefeng. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> In Chicago where it's always cold in winter, it's been much warmer last year than before, and the snowfall was much less than before. It might be not much different next winter. </seg>
<seg id=7> Meanwhile, rainfall in Southeast Asia became much less, and fire caused by drought couldn't be controlled for a couple weeks because of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=8> El Nino and La Nina are the results of a big change of water temperature on the tropic East Pacific surface. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino means the surface water temperature is much higher than usual, which affects the movement of airflow and changes the weather of the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nina means the water temperature of the tropic Pacific surface is much lower than usual, which affects exactly the opposite of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=11> Lyford, the meteorologist of the American Meteorology Department, said that the danger of fire in Indonesia next year might be under control because it's estimated that the rainfall from this December to next March will be more than usual. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time, the temperatures in West Africa and Southeast Africa will be lower than usual, and the rainfall in Northern South America will increase. </seg>
<seg id=13> It's dry in the south of America, which means there might be drought in Texas and New Mexico, and It's more possible to have forest fires in Florida. </seg>
<seg id=14> This year the torrential rain in California and southern areas was attributed to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Lyford said that El Nino would not bring thunderstorms, but it could form the conditions for serious thunderstorms. </seg>
<seg id=16> It's one of the hottest summers in America this year. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some linked global warming with El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lyford thought it possible, but it had not been proved so far. </seg>
<seg id=19> No matter whatever reasons, in America the following winter in the north and the central west would be much colder than last year with more snow. </seg>
