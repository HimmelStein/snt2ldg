<seg id=1> Philippine Foreign Minister: There is no way for Cambodia to join in ASEAN next month. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> French News Agency, Manila Philippine Foreign Minister Ziazon said the day before yesterday that during the Summit Conference of ASEAN in Hanoi next month, there would be no way for Cambodia to join in ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Ziazon said that even though the hostile parties in Cambodia formed a united government before the conference, it could not become automatically a member of ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said: "Many member countries of ASEAN are uncertain. </seg>
<seg id=5> There are many problems at the moment, and the political process in Cambodia is still in progress. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accepted them as a new member, and then they began to fight again, we would have to solve the problem." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Malaysian Foreign Minister Albar said that whether Cambodia could join in ASEAN depended on whether there was a legal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Ziazon said: "Someone said that we had been burnt once, hadn't we? When we were going to accept them, a couple of days later they began fighting again " </seg>
<seg id=9> He obviously meant that Cambodia was nearly accepted to join in ASEAN in April 1997. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> At that time Cambodia failed to join in ASEAN mainly because Hun Sen overthrew Khmer Rouge by military force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won the election this July, but the party couldn't gain a two-thirds majority in the congress to be in power alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen came to an agreement with Khmer Rouge on forming a united government, but the new government hadn't come into being. </seg>
