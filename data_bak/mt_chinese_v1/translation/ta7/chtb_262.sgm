<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1 September, by Yuan Yanghe Professor and artist Liu Yuyi, who caused a sensation throughout the field of arts with his famous oil painting named "Beautiful Night", recently found a rain-flower stone, "the Five Features' stone of the Divine Land", and revealed it to the public. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The shape and size of the rain-flower stone looked very much like the popular lucky article of Long-Life Lock. </seg>
<seg id=4> Right in the middle of the rain-flower stone is a very clear image of the territory of the People's Republic of China. </seg>
<seg id=5> Both sides of the image stand tall and erect, and the middle caves in. The bottom right part is protruding just like a rooster throwing out its chest and stomach, and stretching his neck crowing. By the side of the stomach of the "rooster" is a "strait", the long and narrow "Taiwan Straits". Below the claw of the "rooster" is the round "Hainan Island". </seg>
<seg id=6> The color of the two "islands" is exactly the same as the "mainland". </seg>
<seg id=7> The whole image looks exactly like the territory of China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Professor Liu Yuyi said that five years ago he picked up the rain-flower stone by the road next to a processing factory of rain-flower stones on the outskirts of Nanjing, and noticed that "the territory of China" was on it. </seg>
<seg id=9> At the same time, he noticed that above the territory along the borders of northeast, North China to west east, there was a huge dragon with a bright pearl in its mouth. Above the dragon, there was a golden facula with a shoe-shaped gold. In the middle of the territory was a stripe like a group of torches, symbolizing the endless life-fire of the Chinese nationality. There were five features including the shape of Long-Life Lock. </seg>
<seg id=10> Therefore, Liu Yuyi named the stone " the Five Features' Stone of the Divine Land". </seg>
