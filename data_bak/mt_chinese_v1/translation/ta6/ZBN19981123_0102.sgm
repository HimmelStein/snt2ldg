</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Mr. Siazon saild that even if Philippines antagonist groups could form a coalition government before the summit, it would't become member of ASEAN spontaneously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said," many members of ASEAN were still hesitating, </seg>
<seg id=5> because many problems remained unsettled at present and the political process of Cambodia was still going on. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we commit their membership and then they again start to fight each other, we would still have to solve this problem." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Mr. Abdullah, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, said that whether Cambodia could make its accession into ASEAN depended on whether they could set up a legal government. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=8> Mr. Siazon said, "someone used to say, haven't we been burned once before? When we were ready to accept them, it didn't take long before they fought agaion." </seg>
<seg id=9> obviously referring to the Cambodia's attempt of accession to ASEAN in April, 1997. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The reason that Cambodia failed that time was that Hun Sen overturned Samdech Ranariddh by force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
