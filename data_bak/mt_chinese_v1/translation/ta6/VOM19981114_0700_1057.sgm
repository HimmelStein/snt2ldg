<seg id=1> A US arms control delegation bounded for Beijing to discuss China's rapid accession to the Missile Technology Control Regime believed that China was likely to continue exporting missile technologies to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Now it is the comprehensive report by VOA correspondent Fang Yuan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A group of US officials led by Holem, acting Deputy Secretary of State held one-and-half-day talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, PLA Deputy General Chief of Staff Xiong Guangkai and some other Chinese arms control experts on China's accession to the Missile Technology Control Regime. </seg>
<seg id=4> The talks were focused on how to realize Chinese President Jiang Zemin's indication during President Clinton's visit to China this June. </seg>
<seg id=5> Jiang Zemin indicated at that time China would consider joining the Missile Technology Control Regime This was regarded as one of the major achievements of the meeting of Chinese and US leaders. </seg>
<seg id=6> One of the US delegates said to AP that US side had certain doubts on whether China was still exporting missile components and technologies by now, and that Pakistan and Iran were two beneficiary countries of China's export of missile technologies. </seg>
<seg id=7> The official said US kept on raising this question to China. He believed that China is now taking steps to settle these questions. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is an issue of frequent conflicts in Sino-US relations all the time that China is exporting missile technologies. </seg>
<seg id=9> Ever since India and Pakistan-two old rivals on the subcontinent of South Asia carried out nuclear tests one after another in the first half of this year, US has felt particularly essential to make China commit itself to controlling missile technology transfers, for Pakistan, one of the rivals in the nuclear race in South Asian subcontinent, is China's long-term ally. </seg>
<seg id=10> Early in 1993, US imposed economic sanctions over China since China sold missile components and technologies to Pakistan. Not until China guaranteed to stop exporting ground-to-ground missiles did China make US lift its sanctions against China in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=11> US also worried that the missile deal between China and Iran would constitute a severe threat to US allies in the Middle East as well as to US interests. </seg>
<seg id=12> But the US official revealing the above information refused to explain in detail what type of missile technologies and when China ever offered to Pakistan and Iran. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said there was no sufficient evidence yet to verify China really exported missile technologies to these two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> Whenever US obtained the evidence that China exported missile technologies to these two countries in the past, more often than not China would deny it, or stated that those were dual-purpose technologies, and that the technologies it exported were used for the purpose of peace. </seg>
<seg id=15> So far Chinese side has not yet made public responses to what the US delegation said. </seg>
<seg id=16> In addition, according to the AP report from Beijing, Washington has already confirmed that the country, which helped Pakistan develop and launch the "Korea" missile in April this year was not China but North Korea. </seg>
