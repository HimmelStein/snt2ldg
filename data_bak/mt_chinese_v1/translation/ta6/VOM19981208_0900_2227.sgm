<seg id=4> Mr. Sheng Huairen, head of the China State Economy and Trade Committee said that Chinese army would completely strip off the relations with its subordinating enterprises before Dec. 20th. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other party and judicial authorities should take similar actions from the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> In July this year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered the army and armed forces to stop running companies, hotels and other commercial organizations so as to control the spreading corruption and smuggle phenomena within the army. </seg>
<seg id=7> Mr. Sheng huairen said that until now, some army run enterprises in Shanghai and Tianjin had already being taken under local government's control. But he did not announce whether the army would receive compensations. </seg>
<seg id=8> Apart from the army who must hand in the control of subordinate enterprises, party and judicial authorities will no longer run subordinating SOEs. </seg>
<seg id=9> The Chinese SOE has more than 1000 million employees. Because of serious problems of bad debt and dead debt and also the slump export market brought by the global economical crises, many SOE are in fact on the edge of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huairen said that the number of employees in many SOEs now is more than ten times larger than what they actually need. This has worsening their deficit situations for the past year. </seg>
<seg id=11> This also showed that it's urgent matter for the SOE to strengthen its market competity. </seg>
<seg id=12> What's more, analyst said that corruption and mal-managing situations generally lies in government and judicial authorities that are in charge of SOEs. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common situation is, many government officials taking charge of some industry are also in charge of the running of enterprises in the same field. </seg>
<seg id=14> They can for this reason use their authority to provide these enterprises with preferential tracts, loans and tax. </seg>
<seg id=15> This phenomenon has broken the fair competition in market and as a result, obstructs the Chinese economy to change from planned economy to market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> It is said that more than 500 biggest SOEs which were subordinated to party and judicial authorities in the past will be under supervision by a committee set by the State Council. The personnel department will arrange the employees from these enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=17> The local government will manage some small-scale enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=18> Besides, the Ministry of finance will unitarily control financial and investing companies. </seg>
<seg id=19> It is still unclear by far whether these changes will make the state to give less loan to the SOEs and drive some big enterprises gradually toward bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts believe that China will likely take the way of combining instead of bankruptcy to solve the deficit problem for SOEs because it's been worried that high unemployment ratio might bring social turbulence. </seg>
