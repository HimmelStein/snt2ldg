<seg id=8> Magi said that what he recently saw in Malaysia when attending the APEC meetings and the situations in China where the Chinese government recently arrested people with different opinions made him firmly believes that no matter providing financial aid or managing international trade, Canada should sell its own values while exporting its products. </seg>

<seg id=10> Canadian Broadcasting Service reported that according to the suggestions from Diplomatic Committee of Canadian State Congress Senate, the Canadian government could improve the local human-right situations while re-verifying different kinds of foreign aid projects when trying to help other countries to develop economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> State Post Newspaper reported that different signs showed that Canadian government was trying to adjust its policy towards Asian countries including China while the report from Diplomatic Committee of State Congress Senate was just one of different indications. </seg>
<seg id=12> Thursday, Canadian Foreign Minister Axewacy said that Canada was very much concerned about the situations in which Chinese government had arrested people with different opinions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said that we should take reactions toward this. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have already pointed out that what the Chinese government did for arresting people with different opinions has infringed the UN Convention on citizen's rights and political rights which China has already signed. </seg>
<seg id=15> Canadian Broadcasting Service reported that in fact, during his visit to China last month, the Canadian Premier Raidian criticized Chinese human-right records many times in public occasions which changed his way of not openly accuse China for more than two years. </seg>

<seg id=17> State Post Newspaper reported that people in Canadian business circles showed different responds to the attitude Minister of international trade Mr. Magi took to support connecting the trade with human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> Someone privately worried that this will influence the Canadian enterprises' business. </seg>
<seg id=19> But, Doctor Zhu Yu from the Orcnagen University in Great Britain Columbia County has different views. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> For the capital in North America, one of the important reasons for them to change to East Asia to invest, set up factories and do business is to make money and profit. </seg>
<seg id=21> But when entering these East-Asian countries, they can also bring some standards like protection for workers, social welfare for the workers and environmental standards to these countries. </seg>
<seg id=22> And what they brought can be used as examples, it has very direct influence on improving the local human rights and workers' rights. </seg>
