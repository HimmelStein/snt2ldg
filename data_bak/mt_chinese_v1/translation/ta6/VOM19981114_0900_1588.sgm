<seg id=1> From the meteorological aspect, we know the consequences of the Ernio phenomena last year, which includes continues fire in Indonicia, flood in the desolate area in Beru and serious abnormal climate in extensive part of the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the beginning of this year, flood has crashed California and southern states of US, while afterwards, arid occurred in many places in the south. </seg>
<seg id=3> Experts say that Ernino phenomena is changing into another new phenomena which is called Lanina. </seg>
<seg id=4> And Lanina will take on a surprising show next year, which is no worth than the Ernino phenomena. </seg>
<seg id=5> Now please listen to VOA journalist Li Lan's report from Chicago, given by Qi Zhifeng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> For the usually cold winter in Chicago, last year was much warmer than before and there was much less snow. Maybe next winter will be much the same. </seg>
<seg id=7> Meanwhile, Ernino recklessly indulges in Southeast Asia. Precipitation has greatly decreased. Arid has caused the wild fire to burn for weeks beyond control. </seg>
<seg id=8> Both Ernino and Lanila are the consequences of the extensive changes for the surface water temperature in east tropical pacific. </seg>
<seg id=9> Ernino means that the surface water temperature is much higher than usual. This will influence the trend of the air current and consequently change the climate in different parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> Lanila means that the surface water temperature in tropical pacific is lower than normal. Its influences for the climates in many places happens to be controversial to Ernino. </seg>
<seg id=11> Meteorology experts Larf from the US National Meteorology Bureau says that fire in Indonisia next year will be under control, because the precipitation estimated in this area between this December and next March will be much more than the previous years. </seg>
<seg id=12> While at the same time, temperature in west and southeast Africa will be lower than usual and there will be more rain in the north of south-America. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern part of US will be drier than before which means that arid will continuesly occur in Texas and New Mexico. While the chances for forest fire in Florida will be higher than usual. </seg>
<seg id=14> The heavy rain in Florida and the southern areas this year imputed to the Ernino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Larf says that instead of producing storm, the Ernino provides conditions for the forming of storm. </seg>
<seg id=16> Summer in the US this year proved to be one of the hottest summers in history. </seg>
<seg id=17> Someone connect the Ernino phenomena with the up-going temperature in global area. </seg>
<seg id=18> Larf thinks that this association is possible but it hasn't been proved so far. </seg>
<seg id=19> But no matter what other reasons are, the coming winter for the north and central west part of US will be a colder one with much more snow. </seg>
