<seg id=1> Delegates to the UN Global Climate Conference continued their work in Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the meantime, the Congress of the United States is arguing whether or to approve the Protocol reached at the Kyoto meeting in Japan last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to another report by VOA correspondent Frekuce from Buenos Aires, several congressmen of the United States brought this argument to the Conference hall in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id=4> Now the details from Ma Kaiyue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> US Democratic Senator Leagman and Kree made a statement on Tuesday in Buenos Aires, urging Clinton Administration to endorse the Protocol reached at the Kyoto meeting within this week. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two senators indicated that this would strengthen the stringency of the US representatives and increase the possibility of developing countries to commit to reducing gas exhaustion, a factor of greenhouse effect. </seg>
<seg id=7> In fact, this is the prerequisite raised by Senate for several previous motions. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some congressmen of the United States in Buenos Aires said they opposed any action of this kind by Clinton Administration. </seg>
<seg id=9> Republican Representative Sensen Burena from Wisconsin, Chairman of the Science Committee of the House of Representatives said the Kyoto Agreement had fatal drawbacks and would absolutely be vetoed by the US Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> "Just as it is being laid aside, the Protocol has already doomed when submitted to the Senate. The US Senate will not endorse this protocol." Representative Sensen Burena said. </seg>
<seg id=12> The problem is what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> To try to save it, or to announce that the protocol has fatal drawbacks which needs re-discussion." </seg>
<seg id=14> Representative Sensen Burena said this was not the dispute between two parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States, as indicated by several well-known Democratic congressmen. </seg>
<seg id=15> Democratic Representative Clink from Pennsylvania said why he opposed this protocol was because it will reduce employment opportunities and lower the US industrialization levels so as he called. </seg>
<seg id=16> But Democratic Representative Kusinchi from Ohio disagreed with Sensen Burena. He compared struggling against the rise of global temperature with striving for peace in the world. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said that the same resolve would lead to the success of the Kyoto Protocol. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> "I hope the process would be carried on. At the same time, we ought not to ignore the inevitability of reaching a global solution regardless of the temporary obstinacy of some Congressman no matter the US Congress involved or not" Representative Kusinchi said </seg>
<seg id=20> In the main conference hall in Buenos Aires, delegates are discussing various problems, some of which will undoubtedly be left to 160 energy and environmental ministers of participating countries to decide at the meeting on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id=21> US delegates said the meeting had made certain progress even though some issues of concern to the US Congress might be postponed to the meeting next year for settlement. </seg>
