<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, Aug. 31 (Wang Sen) - Karadzic, chairman of the parliament of "Republic of Serbia" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressed on Aug. 31 in a speech to the newspaper "The Voice of Serbia" that after the plan for the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina proposed by the liaison team was rejected in the referendum, the leaders of Bosnian Serbs can only "negotiate on the new territorial division plan, namely the new Bosnian-Herzegovina peace proposal." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> According to the announcement, in the referendum held on August 27 and 28 by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, over 90% of voters voted against the territorial division plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina proposed by the international liaison team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Karadzic further explained in his speech, "By refusing to accept the territorial division plan, we only refused a part of the Bosnian-Herzegovina Peace Plan. </seg>
<seg id=5> Yet, as the territorial division plan was not accepted in the referendum, the entire peace plan is therefore terminated." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> On the relationship between the Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavia, Karadzic said, "The policy of the West is to split Serbs.  They have been long waiting for this day," whereas "our goal is to unite all the Serbs." </seg>

<seg id=7> Buha, foreign minister of "Republic of Serbia" in Bosnia-Herzegovina also indicated on the same day in his speech to AFP, "After the referendum held by Bosnian Serbs, the Serbs hope that the international liaison team would come up with a new proposal so as to walk out of this blind alley." </seg>
