<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, New York, Mar. 6 (Journalist Zhou Xisheng) - Jim Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, made a speech on the 6th at the luncheon held by the National Committee of Sino-American Relations in New York, calling for America to "adopt sustained, reliable and constructive policies toward China from a strategic perspective" and to solve differences with China over some issues through candid and comprehensive dialogs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Jim Sasser pointed out, America should correctly face the rise of China on the international stage.  Whether it is at the end of this century or in the next century, America should always consider as a great opportunity for its foreign policy to develop steady and healthy relationship with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> While talking about the human rights in China and the protection of intellectual property rights, the ambassador pointed out, China has already achieved significant progress in both aspects. </seg>
<seg id=5> In his opinion, the freedom and democracy that the Chinese people are currently enjoying are unimaginable before; China has also been very cooperative on the protection of intellectual property rights, to which America should not be blind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Jim Sasser also proposes that after China joins the World Trade Organization, the U.S. Congress should call off the annual discussion on the status of China as the most-favored-nation and instead should accord China permanently the most-favored-nation status. </seg>
<seg id=7> He pointed out, the U.S Congress holds the annual debate on this issue only to do harm to America, as the debate affects the American businessmen's confidence in investing in China, and consequently affects the American people's job opportunities. </seg>
