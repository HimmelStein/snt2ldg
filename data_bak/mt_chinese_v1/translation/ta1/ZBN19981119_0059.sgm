<p>
<seg id=2> (Lisbon, AP wire) News from the Attorney General's Office of Portugal said that the General Prosecution Office is studying a Portuguese assembly deputy's request to extradite Suharto, the former president of Indonesia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In his letter, Assembly Deputy Keleiya Xierwa said that Suharto should be extradited for his violation of human rights in East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=4> In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor, the former colony of Portugal, and annexed East Timor into Indonesia's territory a few weeks later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sala Pina, a spokeswoman for the General Prosecution Office, said: "We are studying right now to see if it can be done under Portuguese laws." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Human rights organizations denounced the Indonesian military for its violation of human rights in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Xierwa said, the recent case in which Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, may be extradited to Spain on charges of genocide and other crimes has further increased his determination to have Suharto extradited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> At present, Pinochet is in London, waiting for the Upper House to make the decision whether he will be extradited. </seg>
<seg id=9> The British Supreme Court repealed the initial warrant for Pinochet's arrest by reason that as a former state leader, Pinochet is entitled to immunity from suit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Xierwa is a member of Popular Party, a right-wing party in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id=11> He said, the United Nations still regards Portugal as the legitimate administrator of East Timor, which facilitates their request for Suharto's extradition. </seg>
