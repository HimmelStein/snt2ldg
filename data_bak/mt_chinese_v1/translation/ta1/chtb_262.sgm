<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, Sept. 1 (Journalist Yuan Yanghe) - Professor Liu Yuyi, a painter who created a sensation in the circle of art with his famous painting "Perfect Evening", showed to the public the other day in Nanjing one Yuhua stone he discovered -- "Five-Consummation Stone in the Divine Land." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The shape and size of this Yuhua stone resemble very much the talisman longevity lock in the folk culture. </seg>
<seg id=4> In the center of the Yuhua stone is a very clear-cut image of the map of the People's Republic of China. </seg>
<seg id=5> The two sides of the image are highly raised with a concave center; the right bottom part protrudes out, resembling a rooster puffing up its chest and stretching its neck ready to crow.  Near the rooster's flank and separated by a "strait" is a narrow "Taiwan Island."  Beneath the claws of the rooster is a circle-shaped "Hainan Island." </seg>
<seg id=6> The color of the two "islands" is completely consistent with that of "the mainland." </seg>
<seg id=7> The entire image looks exactly like the map of China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Professor Liu Yuyi said, he found this stone five years ago on a road to a Yuhua stone processing plant on the outskirts of Nanjing.  After he got home and looked at it closely, he found the "map of China" on the stone. </seg>
<seg id=9> At the same time, he also discovered that on the upper part of the map of mainland China along the northeastern, northern China all the way to the northwestern border line lies a giant dragon with a bright pearl in its mouth.  On top of the giant dragon is a golden yellow spot of light that looks like a shoe-shaped gold ingot.  In the center of the map of mainland China, there is a string of streaks in the shape of torches, symbolizing the ever-burning fire of life of the Chinese nation.  In addition, the stone's shape resembles the longevity lock, totaling five special features. </seg>
<seg id=10> Base on these features, Liu Yuyi named this stone "Five-Consummation Stone in the Divine Land." </seg>
