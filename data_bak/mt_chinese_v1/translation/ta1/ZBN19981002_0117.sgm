<seg id=2> (Jakarta, AFP wire) The international organization "Committee to Protect Journalists" that defends the freedom of the press expressed its shock at the Indonesian police's subpoena of a journalist for interrogation because he reported on the rape of a Chinese woman during the May riot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Committee to Protect Journalists officed in New York said, Gunawan, a journalist working for the magazine "Jakarta-Jakarta," was subpoenaed Thursday to the police headquarters for interrogation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> The committee said, Gunawan quoted a rape victim in an article published in July. </seg>
<seg id=5> An article published in The New York Times of June 10 also quoted the same victim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In its letter to the Indonesian President Habibie, the committee said, issuing the subpoena is "the first step taken by the police for prosecution." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The committee is "very concerned that such application of the law would bring negative impact on the freedom of speech." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The committee is referring here to the fact that the Indonesian Muslim organizations have put pressure on the government and demanded that the government arrest Gunawan under Article 156 of the Criminal Code. </seg>
