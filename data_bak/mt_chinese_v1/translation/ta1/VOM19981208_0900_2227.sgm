<seg id=1> Sheng Huaren, a chief officer from National Economics and Trade Committee of China, indicated that the Chinese military and other government agencies will entirely give up the control of their subordinate enterprises within a short period of time. </seg>
<seg id=2> Although China issued similar directives several times in the past, its determination to take the action this time seems to be greater than before. </seg>
<seg id=3> Now, please listen to a report written by VOA correspondent Ning Xin. </seg>

<seg id=4> Sheng Huaren, a chief officer from the National Economics and Trade Committee of China, indicated that the Chinese military will separate themselves completely from their subordinate enterprises by Dec. 20. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other Party and government agencies and judicial departments must also take similar actions early next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> In July this year, Jiang Zemin, chairman of the People's Republic of China, ordered the military and People's Armed Police to stop operating enterprises, hotels and other commercial facilities in order to control the ever-spreading corruption and smuggling within the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren indicated that as of now, some enterprises subordinate to the military in Shanghai and Tianjin have already shifted their control to the local governments, but he did not clarify whether the military will be compensated. </seg>
<seg id=8> In addition to the military that must hand over the control of its subordinate enterprises, the Party, government agencies and judicial departments shall also stop operating the state-owned enterprises subordinate to them. </seg>
<seg id=9> There are over 100 million of employees in the state-owned enterprises.  Due to serious problems of bad debts, dead accounts and the slowdown in the export market resulting from the global economic crisis, many state-owned enterprises are actually on the brink of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said, at present, in many state-owned enterprises, the number of people employed is over ten times more than the actual number needed.  As a result, these businesses suffered even greater losses last year. </seg>
<seg id=11> This demonstrates that increasing the market competitiveness of the state-owned enterprises has become a top priority at the moment. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, analysts claim that there are widespread corruption and mismanagement in the government agencies and judicial departments that supervise the state-owned enterprise. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common scenario is that many government officials in charge of one industry are at the same time in charge of the operation of enterprises in the same industry. </seg>
<seg id=14> Therefore, they can take advantage of the power associated with their positions to provide these enterprises with preferential treatment in respect of contracts, loans and taxes. </seg>
<seg id=15> This phenomenon harms the fair competition in the marketplace and consequently hinders China's transition from the planned economy to the free market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> It is learned that the 500-plus largest state-owned enterprises originally subordinate to the Party and government agencies and judicial departments would be placed under the supervision of a newly established committee under the State Council.  The employees of these enterprises will be managed by the personnel department. </seg>
<seg id=17> Smaller enterprises will be managed by the local government. </seg>
<seg id=18> In addition, financial and investment companies will also be placed under the uniform management of the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> At present, it is not clear whether these changes mean the government will reduce the loans to the state-owned enterprises so as to let some large enterprises go bankrupt step by step. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts think that China, for fear that high unemployment rate might give rise to social disturbances, may solve the problem of losses in the state-owned enterprises mainly through mergers rather than bankruptcy. </seg>
