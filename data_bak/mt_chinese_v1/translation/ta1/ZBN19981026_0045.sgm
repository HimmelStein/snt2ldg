</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Detroit, AFP wire) The Hudson's Building in Detroit that had a history of 107 years turned into a heap of debris within 30 seconds the day before yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> With a height of 25 stories, this building of steel frames is the highest building spot blasted by plastic explosives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Hudson's Building used to be the largest retail store in the world and also a landmark of the city of Detroit. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the sound of the implosions that used 1,215 kilograms of plastic explosives, the building was finally reduced to 306 million kilograms of rubble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At 5:45 p.m. local time, a series of implosions started in the Hudson's Building.  Thick and hot dust grew into a gigantic mushroom, engulfing all the spectators nearby. </seg>
<seg id=7> One resident said: "I didn't expect to be covered with black dust all over my body." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> As the building collapsed, some spectators cheered with joy, while others were wiping their tears because they would no longer be able to see this familiar building again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> In its heyday in the 50s, about 100,000 people went shopping in the Hudson's Building every day. </seg>
<seg id=10> At that time, some of the famous movie stars such as Garbo and Peck also once patronized the place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Archer, mayor of Detroit, once indicated to the public that the city authorities would like to present the public with the opportunity of starting the ignition so as to raise 150,000 US dollars of charity donation. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, since the Hudson's Building embodied the past glory of Detroit, nobody would like to start the ignition and personally destroy this building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> A man who maintains that the building be preserved said: "This is sad." </seg>
