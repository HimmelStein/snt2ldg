<seg id=1> Urban Construction, a New Favorite for Foreign Investors in Qinghai </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Xining, Dec. 21 - The urban infrastructure construction that used to discourage foreign capital is now being favored by foreign businessmen and has become a new area for Qinghai to concentrate the utilization of foreign capital following the development of natural resources. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Over a long period of time, the construction of urban infrastructure in the City of Xining lacked sufficient funding.  During the forty-six years from the founding of New China to 1995, there has been only a total funding of about 400 million yuan.  The slow pace in the urban construction has deterred the economic development. </seg>
<seg id=4> In the past two years, a number of foreign businessmen have successively expressed their desire to get involved in the urban construction of Xining City. </seg>
<seg id=5> Taking advantage of this situation, the Qinghai provincial government proposed a general outline of commercializing infrastructure in urban construction and at the beginning of this year approved "Regulations Governing the Encouragement and Introduction of Foreign Investment in the City of Xining." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> As soon as the City of Xining's decision to implement the paid transfer of the right of operation of the eastern exit road was made public, over 10 foreign businessmen came to discuss the matter and the final bid was settled down at 50 million yuan. </seg>
<seg id=7> The renovation project on Old Town Mojiajie designed according to the requirements for a modern city was undertaken exclusively by a Hong Kong firm with an investment of 50 million yuan. </seg>
<seg id=8> The new construction project for the sixth water source utilized nearly 20 million yuan of foreign capital and has a capability of supplying 150,000 ton of water a day, which will greatly ease the water shortage in the City of Xining. </seg>
<seg id=9> A construction agreement has been reached with Taihua Corporation of Hong Kong on the construction project of the city's northern exit road that requires about 180 million yuan of investment.  Several foreign businessmen have also come to discuss the project for southern express beltway. </seg>
