<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Paris, Sept. 1 (Journalist Zhang Youhao) - Leodart, defense minister of France, said on the 1st that France is studying a plan to withdraw its troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Leodart made this remark when he was talking with a radio reporter in Paris. </seg>
<seg id=4> He pointed out, the proposal of the United States to remove the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina would mean "a possible end of international aid" and "another breakout of major open conflicts", which would cause "a serious consequence of great losses." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Leodart said, "Before the safety of the UN peace-keepers can be guaranteed, we cannot accept the removal of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Juppe, foreign minister of France, also expressed explicitly last week that for the embargo to be removed, "the prerequisite is France's withdrawal of its blue-helmet army as well as the withdrawal of all the UN peace-keepers." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out in February, 1992, France has always kept about 4,000 officers and soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is the country in the West that sends out most blue-helmet troops to station in this region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The American president Clinton announced on August 10 that if the Bosnian Serbs still do not accept the peace proposal of the five nations by October 15, he will request the UN Security Council to pass a resolution to remove the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina; if the UN Security Council cannot pass such a resolution, he will seek to remove the arms embargo unilaterally by the United States. </seg>
