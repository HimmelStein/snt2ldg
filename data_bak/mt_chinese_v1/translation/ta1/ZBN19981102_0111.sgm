</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Lisbon, AFP wire) As disclosed by reliable sources, Gama, foreign minister of Portugal, will meet with a UN official in Vienna to discuss the report that there is excessive Indonesian military presence in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Cesar, spokesman for Gama, said that this report contradicts the guarantee that Alatas, foreign minister of Indonesia, made to Gama and UN Secretary-General Annan in August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Cesar said, Alatas once promised to gradually reduce Indonesia's military presence in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The sources disclosed that Gama will discuss the related development with Annan's special representative Mark. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to an apparently confidential document of the Indonesian military circulating among the foreign journalists, there are 17,834 Indonesian soldiers stationed in East Timor as of the end of July this year. </seg>
<seg id=7> The Western embassies said this figure is very close to what they have estimated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> However, General Wiranto, commander-in-chief of the Indonesian armed forces, said that the figure 17,000 is a "lie". </seg>
<seg id=9> He did not reveal the real figure, but the military officials once indicated that about 11,500 soldiers were stationed in East Timor in mid August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Indonesia sent troops to East Timor as early as in 1975, and annexed East Timor the next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> However, the United Nations still considers Lisbon as the official administrator of East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=12> The UN secretary-generals have been sponsoring peace talks between Portugal and Indonesia since 1983. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> The leaders of East Timor, including Nobel Prize winner Belo and Gusmao, leader of the guerrilla forces of Independence Movement of East Timor held in jail, all made statements supporting this report and refuting Jakarta's claim that the troops in East Timor have been reduced. </seg>
