<seg id=1> The delegates to the UN Global Climate Conference held in Buenos Aires, capital city of Argentina, go on with their work. </seg>
<seg id=2> Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress is debating over whether it should approve the agreement reached at Kyoto Conference last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to another report from Buenos Aires by VOA correspondent Fulaikusi, a few U.S. congressmen have brought this debate to the conference hall in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id=4> Please listen to the following details, Ma Kaiyue reporting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Democratic senators of the U.S. Congress, Lieberman and Kerry, made a statement Tuesday in Buenos Aires, urging the Clinton Administration to sign and approve this week the agreement reached at Kyoto Conference. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two senators have both indicated that this will increase the persuasive power of the U.S. delegates and the likelihood that the developing countries will make commitments to reducing the green-house effect and volume of exhaust gas emission. </seg>
<seg id=7> As a matter of fact, this is the prerequisite the Senate proposed in the several previous bills. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some members of the U.S. House of Representatives in Buenos Aires said that they are opposed to the Clinton Administration's making any of such action. </seg>
<seg id=9> Sensenbrenner Jr., a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Wisconsin and chairman of its Science Subcommittee, said that Kyoto Agreement contains fatal flaws and will certainly be vetoed by the U.S. Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> M.H.R. Sensenbrenner said, just as the agreement is now pigeonholed, the agreement simply died on its way to the Senate.  The U.S. Senate is not going to approve this agreement. </seg>
<seg id=12> The question is what we can do at present. </seg>
<seg id=13> Shall we attempt to salvage the agreement, or shall we announce that the agreement has fatal flaws and should be discussed anew. </seg>
<seg id=14> M.H.R. Sensenbrenner said, this is not considered as a bipartisan contention either in the House of Representatives or the Senate.  Some well-known Democratic Representatives also expressed their agreement on this. </seg>
<seg id=15> Klink, a Democratic Representative from Pennsylvania, said that he is opposed to this agreement because it will reduce the employment opportunities and also will reduce the degree of America's industrialization as he mentioned before. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Kucinich, a Democratic Representative from Ohio, did not agree with Sensenbrenner's point of view.  He likened the combat against the global warming to the endeavor for world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said that the same determination will make Kyoto Agreement a winner. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> M.H.R. Kucinichi said, I hope this process will continue.  At the same time, we should not overlook the necessity of reaching a global solution simply because of some congressman's momentary stubbornness, no matter whether there is U.S. Congress'  participation. </seg>
<seg id=20> In the Main Conference Hall in Buenos Aires, delegates are discussing various kinds of issues, some of which will surely be left for the ministers of energy and environment from the 160 participating nations to solve at the meeting on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id=21> The U.S. delegates said, although some of the issues that the U.S. Congress is more concerned about may have to wait for their solution till the conference next year, this conference still has made some progress. </seg>
