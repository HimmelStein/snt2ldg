<seg id=1> The Philippines Accuses Malaysia of Occupying the Philippine Reef Bank </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Reported by Manila correspondent Ferdinand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Philippine officials think that besides China, another country that poses potential threats to the Philippines in the Nansha Islands is Malaysia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A document from the Philippine Military Intelligence Agency shows that the Malaysian troops once attempted to occupy a Philippine reef bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The document says that Malaysia's attempt to occupy this Philippine reef bank poses possible threats to the security of the Philippines as this reef bank is geographically located close to the Palawan Island of the Philippines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The document does not specify when the incident occurred, nor does it explain why the Malaysian troops failed in their attempt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> During an interview with reporters some time earlier, the Philippine military officials said that Malaysia's attempt to occupy this reef bank occurred in August or several months before the Philippines discovered the Chinese navy's activities in Mischief Reef in November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They explained that the timely "persuasion" from the Philippine authorities stopped Malaysia from carrying out its plan in the area, but the officials from the Ministry of Defense of the Philippines did not give any details. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Before the Philippine military disclosed Malaysia's attempt to occupy the Philippine reef bank, President Estrada rejected the military's proposal to take control of the Philippine reef bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> In the same report, the military claimed that the facilities China is building on Mischief Reef will serve as an "access board" through which China will eventually occupy the neighboring Reed Bank and conduct its oil exploration. </seg>
