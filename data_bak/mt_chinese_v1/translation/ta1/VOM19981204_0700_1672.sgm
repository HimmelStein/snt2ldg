<seg id=1> Now, let's first take a look at Canada. </seg>
<seg id=2> Marchi, minister of International Trade of Canada, indicated that while Canada exports merchandise, it should also export its values in an effort to improve human rights conditions in China and other Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id=3> Marchi made this remark as a response to the proposal of linking foreign trade with human rights by the Diplomatic Committee of the Canadian Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=4> Now, please listen to a report from VOA correspondent Yan Ming in Toronto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Marchi, minister of International Trade of Canada, made a very positive response to the proposal of linking foreign trade with human rights put forward in a report by the Diplomatic Committee of the Canadian Senate. </seg>
<seg id=6> Marchi indicated that Canada should add human rights as a new factor to its foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=7> Ottawa Citizen reported that Marchi, minister of International Trade of Canada, made this remark while attending a conference on diplomacy and international trade on Thursday in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id=8> Marchi indicated, what he saw in Malaysia not long ago while attending the summit meeting of Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Organizations there and the recent news about China's arrest of dissidents and so forth have convinced him that Canada should export its values while exporting its merchandise no matter whether it is providing economic aid or is engaged in international trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Human rights and social justice should become an important part of the Canadian foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> According to a report from the Canadian Press, the report from Diplomatic Committee of the Canadian Senate proposes that the Canadian government should review all the foreign aid projects, making sure that while they help the recipient countries in their economic development, they should also help improve human rights conditions there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> National Post reports that various signs indicate that the Canadian government is trying to adjust its policy toward Asian countries, including China; and the report from Diplomatic Committee of the Canadian Senate is only one of the various signals. </seg>
<seg id=12> On Thursday, Canadian Foreign Minister Axworthy indicated that Canada is greatly concerned over China's arrest of dissidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said, we must respond to this incident. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have already pointed out to the Chinese government that the arrest of dissidents violates the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that China signed. </seg>
<seg id=15> The Canadian Press reports that as a matter of fact, during his visit in China last month, Canadian Prime Minister Chretrien changed his practice of making no public censure on China over the last two years and criticized China for its human rights record on several public occasions. </seg>
<seg id=16> This unusual practice from the Canadian prime minister has in fact already indicated that Canada has made some changes in its foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> National Post reports that people in Canada's business circle have mixed responses to International Trade Minister Marchi's support of linking trade with human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> In private, some people are worried, fearing it might affect the businesses in Canada. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, Dr. Zhu Yuchao of Okanagan University of British Columbia, Canada, holds a very different opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> To the capitalists in North America, it does, because they relocate to East Asia to invest, build plants, do trade with making profits as one of their important reasons.  Of course, there should be profits. </seg>
<seg id=21> However, while they go to these countries in East Asia, they can also bring some standards such as labor protection, labor welfare and requirements for environmental protection to these countries.  This is bilateral. </seg>
<seg id=22> And the person who brings these there also serves as a model.  This is going to exert a very direct influence on the improvement of the local human rights conditions and more directly on labor rights.  It is a very direct influence. </seg>
