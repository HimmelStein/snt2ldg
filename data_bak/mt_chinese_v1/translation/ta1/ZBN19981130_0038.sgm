</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Miyazawa's decision to leave or stay also casts some shadow upon the coalition government formed between the Liberal Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and the Liberal Party led by Ichiro Ozawa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> As soon as the senior officials' disagreement surfaced over whether the cabinet seat for the Liberal Party is agreed upon, the coalition government fell into instability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Widespread rumor circulating outside the government has it that Noda, secretary general of the Liberal Party, will replace Miyazawa after he resigns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Miyazawa indicated last Friday that he might resign by the end of the year, yet he did not give a specific date. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said at the press conference: "I can't say when." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> It is expected that he will serve as minister of finance until the two-week special meeting of the Diet is over. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Diet meeting will come to a close on Dec. 14. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Suzuki, deputy cabinet secretary for Keizo Obuchi, told NHK TV that he believes the prime minister wants the 79-year-old Miyazawa to stay in office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Suzuki said: "I think (Obuchi) privately wants him to stay to implement his plan to revive economy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Obuchi will talk with Miyazawa in person. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=16> The public comment Obuchi made on Miyazawa's decision to leave is that he has seen the reports concerning this and is planning to talk with the prime minister. </seg>
