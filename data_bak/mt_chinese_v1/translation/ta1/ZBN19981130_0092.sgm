<seg id=1> Information Minister Rahmat:  Participants in "Don't Let the Fire Die" Demonstration Should not Become Puppets of Foreign Forces </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (From Kuala Lumpur) Mohamed Rahmat, information minister of Malaysia, said that participants in "Don't Let the Fire Die" Demonstration should not become puppets of foreign forces to sabotage the country, but instead should adopt wiser ways to express their wishes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said, to express one's wishes through rational means would be more effective than resorting to violence and disturbances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Malaysian National News Agency reports that Mohamed Rahmat told the media yesterday after attending the Family Day activities organized by the Ministry of Information that the government has already taken measures to let people fully express what they think by setting up 500 "Centers for Airing Points of View" in various parts of the country so that people can give their comments and opinions about their country through proper channels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said, the government will study the comments people give and how they feel so that improvements will be made to meet the needs of the general public. </seg>
<seg id=6> This, he stressed, is the way things are done in a democratic country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He also urged the demonstrators to ponder over the consequences the demonstration has brought, as the prosperity today is only made possible by the devotion to the country and positive construction by the people of the entire country ever since Malaysia declared independence 41 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said, as the demonstrators intensified their full-scale resistance against the government after they obtained the support from the foreign forces, they were not aware that it was an act of selling out their national dignity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He indicated: "If foreigners want to invest in Malaysia, they are always welcome.  Yet, if they pay the demonstrators, we will surely protest." </seg>
