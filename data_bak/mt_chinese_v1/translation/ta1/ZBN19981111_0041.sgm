</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Washington, Reuters) Rivlin, vice-chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board warned on Monday that the global financial storm will cause a considerable slow-down in the U.S. economy.  She also implied that another rate cut may be needed for the U.S. to avoid the economic recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Rivlin said during an interview that she doesn't think the U.S. economy will collapse, but she warned that the reduced export volume and employment opportunities mean the economy will slow down substantially. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Federal Reserve has cut the interest rate twice in the past six weeks so as to keep the U.S. economy from being affected by the severest financial storm in the past 50 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Federal Reserve will meet on Nov. 17 to discuss the rate cut. </seg>
<seg id=6> The public guess is that the Federal Reserve will decide to cut the rate again to keep the economy stable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The U.S. economic growth rate for the third quarter is only 3.3%, lower than the 5.5% for the first quarter. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is predicted that the economic growth in the next few months will further slow down. </seg>
<seg id=9> This is a result of the reduced U.S. export to Asia which in turn affects the investment and output in the U.S. manufacturing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Rivlin pointed out, the tremendous pressure on the U.S. financial market has slightly eased up in the past few weeks. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, she warned, tightened credit is still there. </seg>
