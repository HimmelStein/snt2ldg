<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, Apr. 23 (Journalist Liu Yaming) - Recently, the specialists and scholars have found large quantities of skeletal fossils of dinosaurs in Yangcheng township of Xixia County in Henan Province. </seg>
<seg id=3> This is another major discovery since plenty of valuable fossilized dinosaur eggs were found in the same area early last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The reporter learned from Henan Provincial Research Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology that in early April of this year, the specialists found hundreds of skeletal fossils of dinosaurs, including rib and toe bones in between the two estuary gravel layers in such places as Hutoushan, Yangcheng township of Xixia County. </seg>
<seg id=5> Some are already broken into pieces due to prolonged exposure to the elements above the ground. </seg>
<seg id=6> From the perspective of stratigraphic geology, they all belong to the Cretaceous period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> As estimated by the specialists, there are also large quantities of skeletal fossils of dinosaurs and fossils of other species hidden in the distribution range of dinosaur fossil cluster. </seg>
<seg id=8> In their opinion, while the discovery of the large quantities of valuable fossilized dinosaur eggs in the Xixia basin is already very rare in the world, the coexistence of the skeletal and egg fossils in the same area is even rarer. </seg>
<seg id=9> It is of great significance to the research on the classification of dinosaurs in Xixia area, the exploration of the dinosaurs' ecological habit and reproductive behavior, the restoration of the ecological environment of the Age of Dinosaurs, and the discovery of the laws governing the crustal movement and evolution of the earth's environment. </seg>
<seg id=10> The discovery of the skeletal fossils of dinosaurs also provided important clues for the further search for the patterns associated the geographic distribution and the burial of dinosaur fossils. </seg>
