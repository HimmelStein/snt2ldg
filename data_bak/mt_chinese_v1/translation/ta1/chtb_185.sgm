</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> This newspaper, Paris, Feb. 14 (Journalist Lu Wangda) - French Foreign Minister Dumas pointed out that France will not agree to amend the UN Charter in order to redistribute the seats of five permanent members of the Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> It was yesterday at the conference of Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Parliament of France that the French foreign minister made the above statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In his opinion, the United Nations was born after World War II, and like other permanent members, France is also a victorious nation. </seg>
<seg id=5> Although Germany and Italy as defeated nations have both become democratic countries today, yet, is it enough to clear the past events by merely taking a review of history? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> It is reported here that as today's strong economic powers, some people in Germany and Japan are constantly demanding for a redistribution of the seats of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> German Foreign Minister Gensher made a speech on the 11th, hoping the united Germany can play a greater role in the United Nations and have a bigger say in the decision making of the UN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> For this remark, French Foreign Minister stressed his position by pointing out that these arguments are "unrealistic;"  the seats for the permanent members are designated by the UN Charter which can only be amended upon the consensus of its members.  France will not agree to amend the UN Charter. </seg>
