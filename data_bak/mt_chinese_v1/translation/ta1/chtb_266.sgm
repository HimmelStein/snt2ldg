<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, Aug. 31 (Journalist Huai Chengbo) - Savir, director of General Office of Foreign Ministry of Israel who is on his visit in the U.S., was quoted in today's Jerusalem Post as saying that the World Bank has decided to provide the self-ruling Palestinian National Authority 250 million US dollars in aid before the end of 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This decision broke the deadlock that lasted nearly a year between the donor nations and the self-ruling Palestinian National Authority. </seg>
<seg id=4> On Oct. 1, last year, at the international conference held in Washington on providing aid to Palestinian self-rule, the donor nations promised to provide 2.4 billion US dollars of development aid within a period of five years, of which the 750 million US dollars would be allocated in the first year. </seg>
<seg id=5> But the donor nations claimed that the Palestinian self-rule area lacks the necessary system and accounting to handle the aid and thus refused to fulfil this promise in its entirety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Savir said, although the U.S. and the World Bank are not completely satisfied with the accounting work of Palestine, they still agree to disburse a portion of the sum as soon as possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Arafat, chairman of PLO's Executive Committee, and other Palestinian leaders have been criticizing the donor nations for failing to fulfil the promises and deliver the donation money in full on time. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is expected that PLO's chief negotiator Shalasi and Israel's chief negotiator Luosier will go to Washington to negotiate with the U.S. and the World Bank in detail on how to solve the issue of this aid. </seg>
