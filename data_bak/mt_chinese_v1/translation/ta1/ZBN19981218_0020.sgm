<seg id=2> (From Kuala Lumpur) Wong See Wah, deputy minister of finance of Malaysia, said that by the time the foreign currency control reaches its first anniversary on Sept. 1 next year, it is expected that more than 10 billion Ringgit of foreign capital will have been withdrawn from the stock market.  Therefore, the government will take various measures to create a favorable environment for investment to encourage the foreign capital to remain in Malaysia. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> He said, the economy of Malaysia has already shown signs of recovery based on the economic growth rate of the third quarter, and it is believed that by September next year, the economy will stabilize and the market will be active again.  Foreign investors will also decide to invest in Malaysia. </seg>

<seg id=5> He stressed that the Malaysian government will set the exchange rate of U.S. dollars against Malaysian Ringgit at 1:3.8.  It will encourage investors to make long-term investment plans and to make more accurate investment decisions without having to worry about the currency fluctuations. </seg>

<seg id=6> He said, the control will continue for a period of time until the international currency market stabilizes, an international system for controlling speculative activities is set up, and regulations on currency exchange are well observed.
