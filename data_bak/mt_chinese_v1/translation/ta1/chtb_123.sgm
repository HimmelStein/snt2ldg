<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Jan. 16 (Journalists Xu Xingtang and Qian Yuhong) - Dai Xianglong, president of People's Bank of China, said that China will continue to implement the policy of opening up its financial sector to the outside world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> At the press conference for domestic and foreign journalists held here today, Dai Xianglong stressed that China will not forgo the implementation of its policy of opening up the financial sector to the outside just because of the financial turmoil in some of the Southeast Asian countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that last year, some more foreign banks and insurance companies set up their branch offices in China; and by the end of the year, the number of foreign-invested and business-oriented financial institutions had exceeded 170. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the future, the number of branch offices in China set up by foreign banks and insurance companies may be appropriately increased; meanwhile plans are underway to expand pilot programs for Renminbi exchange in foreign banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At the same time, he also stressed that in the future more cautious steps will be taken to oversee the application requirements for foreign financial institutions to set up their businesses in China, the qualification of their senior personnel and the lawfulness of their business operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> As there is no time table in the first place for exchangeability for Renminbi funded projects, he said, there doesn't exist the issue of delaying the procedures as a result of financial crises in Southeast Asia. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, with regard to opening capital projects, the financial crisis in Southeast Asia is a lesson to be learned so that more caution will be adopted. </seg>
