<seg id=1> Philippine Foreign Minister: No Hope for Cambodia to Join ASEAN Next Month </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Manila, AFP wire) Philippine Foreign Minister Siazon said the day before yesterday that there is no hope for Cambodia to join ASEAN during the summit meeting of chiefs of states from ASEAN nations to be held next month in Hanoi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Siazon said, even if the oppositions in Cambodia form a coalition government before the summit meeting, it will not become a member nation of ASEAN automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said: "Many ASEAN member nations are still hesitating. </seg>
<seg id=5> There are many problems at present, and the political process in Cambodia is still going on. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accepted them as a new member now, we would have to tackle the problem anew if they started to fight again afterwards." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Earlier this week, Abdullah, foreign minister of Malaysia, said that ASEAN's acceptance of Cambodia's membership will depend on whether it can establish a legitimate government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Siazon said: "Someone said, didn't we get burned once before?  We were just preparing for their membership when they started to fight again within a matter of only a few days." </seg>
<seg id=9> Obviously, he was referring to the events in April, 1997 when Cambodia almost joined ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The main reason why Cambodia's membership in ASEAN fell through at that time was that Hun Sen overthrew Prince Ranariddh by force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> The People's Party of Cambodia led by Hun Sen won the election this July, yet the party was unable to gain the two-thirds majority of the parliamentary seats required for the single party administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen reached an agreement with Ranariddh on forming a coalition government, but the new government has not really been established yet. </seg>
