<seg id=1> Lien Hoe Expected to Redeem the Remaining 65% Bonds By Year's End </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (From Kuala Lumpur) Lien Hoe is expected to redeem the current remaining 65% of bonds or bonds with a total value of 53,810 million Ringgit by the end of this year through financing bank loans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Lien Hoe has issued redeemable indemnity bonds at 6% APR that have a total value of 85,740,000 Ringgit, and they matured on August 17, 1998. </seg>
<seg id=4> Due to the devaluation of the real estate market and tightened circulating funds, Lien Hoe was able to redeem only 35% of the bonds on the maturity date, while the maturity date of the remaining 65% of bonds is extended to August 17, 2000 at 15% APR. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Lien Hoe obtained the approval from the Securities Exchange Supervision Commission last month to extend the maturity date of its bonds to August 17, 2000.  The group is also the first company in the country to have obtained approval to extend the maturity date of bonds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> As the interest rate has dropped in the current market, Lien Hoe plans to redeem the remaining bonds through bank loans in the hope that it will not have to pay the higher annual interest rate of 15% to the bond holders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Zeng Hualong, director and manager of the company, indicated that as the current interest rate has already dropped and the new financial budget bill is favorable to the development of the real estate industry, Lien Hoe is expected to turn the bad situation in the first half of the year by the second half of the year when it will achieve better performance. </seg>
