<seg id=1> From meteorological perspective, we know that El Nino last year caused serious consequences, including the incessant conflagrations in Indonesia, the floods in the desert areas in Peru, and serious abnormality in regional climates throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the United States, flood hit California and all the southern states at the beginning of the year.  After that, drought occurred in many parts of the South. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to the experts, El Nino is now transforming into a new phenomenon called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> And La Nina is going to create a sensation next year no less than that by El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Now please listen to a report from Chicago by VOA correspondent Li Lan.  Your announcer is Qi Zhifeng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In Chicago, where it used to be very cold in winter, it was much warmer last year with a much smaller snowfall.  It is probably not going to be very different next winter. </seg>
<seg id=7> Meanwhile, El Nino played havoc in Southeast Asia with drastic decrease in precipitation and drought-induced wild fire that burned out of control for weeks. </seg>
<seg id=8> Both El Nino and La Nina resulted from a substantial change in surface water temperature in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino refers to a surface water temperature much higher than normal that affects the movement of air currents and consequently changes the regional climates in various parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nina refers to a surface water temperature much lower than normal that affects many regional climates in exactly the opposite way as El Nino does. </seg>
<seg id=11> Lafu, a meteorologist from the U.S. National Weather Service, said that next year's conflagrations in Indonesia may not burn out of control as the rainfall in the region from December of this year to next March is estimated to be larger than usual. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time, West Africa and Southeast Africa will have a lower than usual temperature, while there will be more rainfall in the northern part of South America. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern half of the United States will be drier than usual.  This means that there may be prolonged drought in Texas and New Mexico, while forest fires in Florida are more likely than usual. </seg>
<seg id=14> The torrential rain that fell in California and the South this year was all attributed to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> El Nino, Lafu said, will not cause rainstorms but will provide conditions for the forming of serious rainstorms. </seg>
<seg id=16> This summer is one of the hottest in the history of the United States. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some people link the global warming with El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lafu thinks there is a possibility for this association but so far it is not yet confirmed. </seg>
<seg id=19> Yet, no matter what other reasons there may be, to people in the United States, it means the coming winter in the North and the Midwest will be much colder and with more snowfall than last year. </seg>
