<seg id=1> A U.S. arms control delegation on its way to Beijing to discuss China's earliest possible entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime thinks that China may still be exporting its missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Now, please listen to VOA correspondent Fang Yuan's comprehensive coverage. </seg>

<seg id=3> A group of U.S. officials led by Holum, the acting Under Secretary of the U.S. State Department, had a meeting in Beijing with Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign minister, Xiong Guangkai, the deputy chief of the general staff of the Chinese military and other Chinese arms control experts.  The meeting lasted a day and half and covered the issue of China's entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime. </seg>
<seg id=4> The meeting mainly focused on how to materialize what Jiang Zemin, chairman of the People's Republic of China, indicated during President Clinton's visit in China in June this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> At the time, Jiang Zemin indicated that China would consider its entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime, which was already considered as one of the major achievements from the summit meeting between the United States and China. </seg>
<seg id=6> One member of the U.S. delegation indicated to the Associated Press that the American side has some concerns about whether China is still exporting missile parts or missile technology while Pakistan and Iran have benefited from the missile technology exported by China. </seg>
<seg id=7> This official said that the United States will continue to ask China this question and that he believes China is also taking measures to solve these problems. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's export of missile technology has been an issue that often causes frictions in the Sino-U.S. relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Since India and Pakistan, the two long-time foes in South Asia subcontinent, successively conducted nuclear tests in the first half of this year, the United States has felt a stronger need that China should make commitments to controlling the transfer of missile technology, because Pakistan, one of the adversaries in the nuclear arms race in South Asia subcontinent, is a long-time ally of China. </seg>
<seg id=10> The United States imposed economic sanctions against China as early as in 1993 when China sold missile parts and technology to Pakistan.  Only when China promised to stop exporting the surface-to-surface missiles did the United States call off the sanctions against China in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=11> The United States is also concerned that the missile transactions between China and Iran will pose serious threats to the U.S. allies in the Middle East and to the U.S. interests. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the U.S. official who disclosed the above information declined elaborating on what kind of missile technology China has supplied to Pakistan and Iran and when these technologies are provided. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said, so far there hasn't been sufficient evidence to prove that China has indeed exported the missile technology to these two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> As ever before, whenever the United States obtained the evidence that China exported the missile technology to these two countries, China would either deny it or claim that these technologies are the so-called dual-purpose technologies and that the technologies it exported were used for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id=15> As of now, the Chinese side has not made any public response to the remark made by the official from the U.S. delegation. </seg>
<seg id=16> In addition, according to a report from the Associated Press in Beijing, Washington has already confirmed that the country that helped Pakistan in the research and development of a Ghauri missile that was launched in April of this year is not China but North Korea. </seg>
