<seg id=1> Feeling Discriminated Against by Native Australians, Thousands of British Immigrants Left Australia </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Sydney, AFP wire) A survey released yesterday finds that due to the "Anglophobia" and the discrimination from the native Australians, thousands of British immigrants decide to leave Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Association of British Immigrants appeals to the government to face up to this problem in the economic interests of the local immigrants as well as Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hante, chairman of the association, pointed out that the British think the native Australians harbor the "Anglophobia"; and the Australian economy "may very likely lose millions of dollars every year because of this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said, it is very disappointing that so many Britons choose to leave Australia because nearly everyone who leaves is a financially independent skilled worker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told the reporters: "According to the immigration regulations, these immigrants are certainly not the ones you want to get rid of." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The British account for 14% of the Australian immigrant population. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, the statistics from Bureau of Immigration show that from 1996 to 1997, while 11,978 new British immigrants came to Australia, 3,737 people left during the same period of time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Hante said, after the association itself conducted the survey in Melbourne, it found that one-fourth of the British believe they are discriminated against in Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 40% of the people interviewed think the native Australians favor non-British immigrants. </seg>
<seg id=11> 37% point out that the complaints from the British immigrants do not get the same serious treatment that other ethnic groups are getting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> About 35% of the people interviewed blame the media as the chief culprit for making the native Australians prejudiced against the British immigrants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Hante said, the anti-British position of the former Australian Prime Minister Keating himself played no better role. </seg>
