<seg id=2> (Sydney, AFP wire) Taib Mahmud, chief minister of Sarawak Province of Malaysia, said that Anwar, the former deputy prime minister of Malaysia detained, may have committed all the crimes he is accused of, including sodomy. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "I already know the charges he faces. </seg>
<seg id=5> I think, it is likely that he will be convicted of the charges." </seg>

<seg id=6> Anwar was removed from his office in early September.  After a series of reform demonstrations, he was arrested under the internal security decree on September 20, and was accused of 10 counts of crimes, including 5 counts of sodomy and 5 counts of embezzlement. </seg>

<seg id=7> When he made his first public appearance on Tuesday, nine days after being detained by the police, his left eye was black and swollen, and he had bruises on his hands.  He denied all the charges in court. </seg>

<seg id=8> Taib is currently attending an international alumni conference in the city of Adelaide. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> He said, "Law is fair...If he is innocent, I believe he will be released." </seg>
<seg id=11> However, if he is convicted, he should be punished just as any other Malaysian citizen." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Taib also attributed the recently tarnished international image of Malaysia to Anwar. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said, "I think, what is detrimental to our image is not what has happened here but rather the remarks Anwar made." </seg>
