<seg id=1> Overhead Railroad Project in Bangkok to be Resumed </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Bangkok, AFP wire) The Ministry of Transportation of Thailand announced yesterday that Thailand will ask Hopewell, a Hong Kong listed company contracted to build the overhead railroad and highway systems, to pay a compensation of 6.8 billion US dollars(about 11 billion Singapore dollars) for its failure to complete the construction according to the schedule specified in the contract. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Pradit, deputy minister of transportation of Thailand, said that the Ministry of Transportation of Thailand and the National Bureau of Railroad are entitled to this claim of 6.8 billion US dollars against Hopewell as a compensation for the loss resulting from the delay of the project.  Thailand accuses Hopewell of completing only 12% of the originally planned project in the past eight years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hopewell negotiated many times to no avail with the relevant Thai authorities over the intensified financial disputes resulting from the depreciation of Thai currency following the economic crisis in Thailand and the dispute in the proceeding of the land requisition.  The Thai government terminated the contract with Hopewell in January this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> For this, Hopewell demands that the Thai government pay the company 100 billion Thai baht (about 4.2 billion Singapore dollars) to compensate for the funds already invested and the part of the project that has been completed during the course of the past eight years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The Thai government said yesterday that Thailand is planning to resume this project which costs a total of 3.2 billion US dollars, but at the same time, it is considering reducing the size of the project. </seg>
<seg id=7> However, under any circumstances, Hopewell will not be allowed to get involved again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Pradit said, the German government and Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KFW) are interested in reviving this gigantic project and have already decided to provide 100 million Thai baht to fund a feasibility study on the project of overhead railroad and highway systems in Bangkok. </seg>
