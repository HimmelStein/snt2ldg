<seg id=2> News from our reporter He Huangbiao in Beijing, Jan. 5: Wangma Group, a high-tech enterprise in Zhongguanchun, Beijing, held a press conference in Great Hall of the People on Jan. 4 and announced that in order to meet the urgent needs of office automation of all agencies of the Communist Party, the government and the military, the company decided to waive the technology fees for its entire set of "Wangma's State-of-the-Art Software" that would have brought in a profit of over a million yuan, and "open" it for domestic public use through floppy disks distributed without password protection so that any computer user in the country can copy and use it. </seg>

<seg id=3> Wangma Group is named after "WUBI",  the Chinese encoding method invented by the famous computer guru Wang Yongmin. </seg>
<seg id=4> This simple and efficient input method has been adopted by over 85% of computer users in the country and has become the dominant input method in our country for Chinese characters. </seg>
