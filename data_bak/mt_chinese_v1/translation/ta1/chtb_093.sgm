</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Gu Yongjiang indicated, the economic development of the Inland provides Hong Kong with five great opportunities: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> -- Good for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
<seg id=4> The economy of Hong Kong will benefit from the long-term and steady growth of the thriving economy of the Inland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> -- Providing Hong Kong with more business opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=6> As the Inland opens up step by step to the outside world in such service areas as trade, finance, and retail, the service industry in Hong Kong will gain greater space for growth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> -- Good for consolidating the trade and shipping center of Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id=8> By 2010, the total value of the foreign trade in the Inland is expected to reach 800 billion US dollars.  This will no doubt increase the demand for transit and transfer business in Hong Kong and thus help consolidate Hong Kong's position as the center of trade and shipping. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> -- Further promoting the development of Hong Kong's financial market. </seg>
<seg id=10> With deepening reform in the state-owned enterprises, more and more stock companies will go public outside mainland China.  Hong Kong will be the first-choice location for state-owned enterprises to go public outside mainland China. </seg>
<seg id=11> This will expand the scale of Hong Kong stocks, improve the composition structure of the stock market and promote the development of the securities market in Hong Kong.  There will also be more China-related funds in Hong Kong.  All this will consolidate and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> -- Good for increasing the international competitiveness of products made in Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id=13> The complementary economic relationship between the Inland and Hong Kong combines the advantages of both places and may thus increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's products in the global market. </seg>
