</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua New Agency report of September 1 from Paris (by staff reporter Zhang Youhao) - French Defense Minister Leotaire said on September 1 that France is preparing a military withdrawal plan from Bosnia-Herzegovina. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Leotaire made this statement in an interview here with a radio station in Paris. </seg>
<seg id=4> He pointed out that the US proposal to list weapon sanction on Bosnia-Herzegovina means "the possible end of international assistance" and "the outbreak of serious and open conflicts", which will result in "the severe consequence of serious losses." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Leotaire said, "we cannot accept any lifting of the weapon sanctions imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina when the security of the UN peace-keeping army cannot be guaranteed." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> French Foreign Minister Jupe explicitly indicated last week that the lifting of sanctions shall be "conditioned upon the withdrawal of French Blue-Beret troops and all UN peace-keeping army." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since the outbreak of Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, France has sent an army of 4,000 officers and soldiers to Bosnia-Herzegovina. </seg>
<seg id=8> France is the western country that has sent the largest number of Blue-Beret troops to the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> US President Clinton said on August 10 that if the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina do not accept the Five-Nation Peace Plan by October 15, he will request the UN to adopt a resolution to lift the weapon sanction against Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the Security Council fails to pass such a resolution, the US will unilaterally seek to lift such sanction against Bosnia-Herzegovina. </seg>
