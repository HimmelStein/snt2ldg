<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of February 7 from Taiyuan (by staff reporter Shan Baohong and Trainee Hu Jingguo) - The Fenglingdu Economic Development Zone, also known as the "Golden Triangle" of the Yellow River due to its location at the juncture of China's Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan provinces, has increasingly drawn the attention of Chinese and foreign investors and become a new hot spot for investment. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> The Fenglingdu Economic Development Zone is the only one in China that is built on the basis of a small town and serves as a new passage for inland Shanxi Province to establish contacts with the outside. </seg>
<seg id=4> Through more than three years of construction, the development zone has begun to take shape and turned into a comprehensive wholesale market for lumber, medicinal herbs, tobacco, clothing, food and oil, and various industrial products. </seg>

<seg id=5> At present, rows of buildings have been erected inside the development zone where many businessmen gather. A multi-purpose and modern shopping center - the Golden Triangle New Village - is in its closing stage of construction. Two-thousand lines of program-controlled telephones have been put into use. The 10KV power line is in normal operation. The development zone has attracted large groups of investors. More than 30 factories in the development zone, including a lemon factory, a perfumery and a special paint factory, offer a steady supply of products to the inland regions. The three newly-built orthopedic, gynaecologic and pediatric hosipitals are equipped with advanced facilities and have been opened to the public. </seg>
