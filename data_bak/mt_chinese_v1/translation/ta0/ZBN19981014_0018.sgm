</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP report from Bangkok) The Ministry of Transport and Communications of Thailand announced yesterday that Thailand will demand Hopewell Group, a Hong Kong listed company, which contracted for the construction of the Bangkok Overhead Railway and Highway System, for damages worth US$6.8 billion (approximately 11 billion Singapore dollars) for its failure to perform the contract as scheduled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Vice Minister Pharatid of the Ministry of Transport and Communications of Thailand said the Ministry of Transport and Communications of Thailand and the State Department of Railways are entitled to have a recourse against Hopewell for the damages worth US$6.8 billion for the losses arising from the project delay. Thailand criticized Hopewell for having completed only 12% of the originally scheduled project during the past 8 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hopewell had several negotiations with the relevant Thai authorities in connection with the intensified financial disputes arising from the devaluation of Thai Baht and the land requisition progress disputes following the economic crisis in the country, but achieved no results. In January this year, the Thai Government terminated the contract with Hopewell. </seg>
<seg id=5> As a result, Hopewell has demanded an indemnity worth 100 billion Thai Baht (approximately 4.2 billion Singapore dollars) from the Thai Government to compensate for the investments made over the past 8 years and the completed portions of the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The Thai Government said yesterday that Thailand is planning to re-start the 3.2 billion US dollar project, but is planning to scale down the project. </seg>
<seg id=7> But in no event will Hopewell be allowed to participate in the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Pharatid said that the German Government and KFW, the German Reconstruction Bank was interested in helping the huge project revive, and had decided to invest 100 million Thai Baht in the feasibility study of the Bangkok Overhead Railway and Highway System. </seg>
