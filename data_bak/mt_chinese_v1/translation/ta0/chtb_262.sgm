<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of September 1 from Nanjing (by staff reporter Yuan Yanghe) - Professor Liu Yuyi, who once created a sensation in the arts circle with his renowned painting of "A Merry Eve", recently exhibited his collection of a Yuhua stone in Nanjing, which he called the "Rare Stone of the Divine Land with Five Unique Features". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The shape and size of the Yuhua stone are very similar to the auspicious Longevity Padlock. </seg>
<seg id=4> The center of the Yuhua stone bears an image which very much resembles the territory of the People's Republic of China. </seg>
<seg id=5> The image rises in both ends, sunken in the middle and protrudes in the lower right portion, just like a crowing cock standing upright; beside the "cock's" stomach and across a "strait" lies a narrow "Taiwan Island"; and below the "cock's" claws lies the round "Hainan Island". </seg>
<seg id=6> The color of the two islands is identical with that of the "mainland". </seg>
<seg id=7> The entire image is very similar to a Chinese map. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Professor Liu Yuyi said that he found this Yuhua stone five years ago along the road to a Yuhua stone processing plant. After careful study, he noticed the "Chinese territory" on the stone. </seg>
<seg id=9> At the same time, he also found a huge dragon with a shining pearl in its mouth above the mainland territory and along China's northeastern, northern and northwestern borderlines. Above the giant dragon, there is a golden flare like a shoe-shaped gold ingot. In the middle of the mainland territory there are a series of torch-like stripes, a symbol of never-extinguishing fire of life of the Chinese nation. These features, together with the shape of the stone like a longevity padlock, add up to a total of five unique features with this stone. </seg>
<seg id=10> Liu Yuyi thus called this stone the "Rare Stone of the Divine Land with Five Unique Features" </seg>
