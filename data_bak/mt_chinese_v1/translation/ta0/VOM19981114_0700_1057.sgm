<seg id=1> A US arms control delegation, which is in Beijing for talks to accelerate the process for China to join the missile technology control agreement, said China may still be exporting missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Following is the summary report by VOA correspondent Fang Yuan: </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> A US delegation led by acting Under Secretary of State Holem held a one and a half day talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Deputy Chief of Joint Staff Xiong Guangkai and some other Chinese arms control experts regarding China's participation in the missile technology control agreement. </seg>
<seg id=4> The meeting concentrated on how to materialize Chinese President Jiang Zemin's promise made in June when President Clinton paid a visit to China. </seg>
<seg id=5> Jiang Zemin promised at that time that China would consider joining the missile technology control agreement, which was seen as one of the major achievements in the China-US summit meeting. </seg>
<seg id=6> One member of the US delegation told AP that the US side suspected that China was still exporting missile parts or missile technology and that Pakistan and Iran were two beneficiaries of China's missile technology export. </seg>
<seg id=7> The official said the US side continued to raise the issue to China and he believed that China was taking measures to resolve these issues. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's export of missile technology has remained an issue which often causes frictions in US-China relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Following the nuclear tests earlier this year by both India and Pakistan, the two arch rivals in the South Asian Subcontinent, the United States felt that it needs China in particular to make an undertaking regarding the control of missile technology transfer, because Pakistan, one of the nuclear contestants in the South Asian Subcontinent, is a long-time ally of China. </seg>
<seg id=10> As early as in 1993, the United States had imposed sanctions on China for its export of missile parts and technology to Pakistan. China only, the United States only lifted the sanctions in 1994 when China promised to stop its export of surface-to-surface missiles. </seg>
<seg id=11> The United States also worries that the missile trade between China and Iran will pose serious threats to US allies in the Middle East and its own interests. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the official who disclosed the above declined to elaborate what kind of missile technology is being exported and when China provided such technology to Pakistan and Iran. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said there was not enough evidence that China did provide missile technology to the two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> In the past, when the United States gathered evidence that China exported missile technology to the above two nations, China either denied the report or insisted it provided dual-use technology and only for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id=15> So far, the Chinese side has not responded publicly to the remarks made by the US delegation official. </seg>
<seg id=16> According to another AP report from Beijing, Washington has confirmed that it was North Korea rather than China which helped Pakistan to develop the "Korea" missile which was launched in April. </seg>
