<seg id=1> Thousands of British Leave Australia Due to Discrimination by Locals </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (APF report from Sydney)A survey released yesterday showed that thousands of British immigrants decided to leave Australia due to local people's "hatred toward Britain" and the discrimination against them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Britain's Immigrants Association has called on the government to face up to the problem for the sake of the immigrants and Australia's economic interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Chairman of the Association Hantel pointed out that the Australians bear "hatred toward Britain" and that Australia's economy is "likely to lose millions of dollars every year for this". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said it was very disappointing that so many British chose to leave Australia because they were almost all skilled workers and economically independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told reporters that "under the immigration rules these immigrants are not those you want to cast off." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The British account for 14% of the immigrant population in Australia. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, statistics released by the Immigration Bureau showed that although there were 11,978 new British immigrants coming to Australia between 1996 and 1997, 3,737 people left the country during the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Hantel said the survey by the Association found that one quarter of the British believe that they are discriminated against in Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 40% surveyed believed that the local people were partial to non-British. </seg>
<seg id=11> 37% pointed out that the complaints of the British couldn't be treated equally like other peoples. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> About 35% surveyed blamed the media for causing prejudice against the British. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Hantel said former Australian Prime Minister Keating's anti-British position also contributed to this. </seg>
