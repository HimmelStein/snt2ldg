</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (APF report from Lisbon) According to reliable sources, Portuguese Foreign Minister Gama will hold talks with a UN official in Geneva on the issue of over-deployment of Indonesian troops in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Saiser, spokesman for Gama, said what the relevant reports say are not in line with what was promised by Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas in August before Gama and UN Secretary-General Koffi Annan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Saiser said Alatas had promised to gradually reduce Indonesian troops in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sources said Gama is scheduled to hold discussions with Annan's representative Mark regarding the relevant developments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to a file, obviously a confidential document of the Indonesian military, which was circulated among foreign journalists, by the end of July, there were 17,834 Indonesian military men in East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=7> Western embassies said the number was very close to what they had estimated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> However, Indonesian Commander-in-chief Wiranto rebuffed it as a "lie". </seg>
<seg id=9> He failed to give the true number but military officials had indicated that there were about 11,500 Indonesian troops in East Timor in August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Indonesia sent its troops to East Timor in 1975 and annexed it in the following year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> However, the United Nations still holds that Lisbon shall be responsible for the administration of East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=12> The UN Secretary-General has been sponsoring peace talks between Portugal and Indonesia since 1983. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> East Timor leaders, including Nobel Prize winner Belo and independence movement guerrilla leader Gusmao, still in jail, have made their statements in support of the relevant reports, refuting Indonesia's claim that it has reduced its troops in East Timor. </seg>
