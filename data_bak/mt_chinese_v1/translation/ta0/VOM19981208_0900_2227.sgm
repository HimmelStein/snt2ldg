<p>
<seg id=4> Minister of China's State Economic and Trade Commission, Sheng Huaren, said the Chinese army will fully break ties with its subordinate businesses before December 20. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other Party, governmental and law enforcement authorities must take similar actions beginning from the start of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> In July, Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered the army and the armed police to stop running enterprises, hotels or other businesses to curb the increasing corruption and smuggling within the army. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren said so far, some businesses in Shanghai and Tianjin had been put under the control to local governments. However, he did not say whether the army would be compensated. </seg>
<seg id=8> Apart from the army, all Party, governmental and law enforcement authorities were also ordered not to run any subordinate businesses. </seg>
<seg id=9> Chinese state-owned enterprises have over 100 million workers. Some of the enterprises are actually on the verge of bankruptcy due to bad debts and sluggish export markets caused by the global economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said many overstaffed State-owned enterprises, which employ ten times as many personnel as they need, incurred greater losses during the past year. </seg>
<seg id=11> This shows that it is an urgent task to strengthen their market competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, analysts say corruption and mismanagement are rampant in governmental in charge of State-owned enterprises and law enforcement departments. </seg>
<seg id=13> It is very common for many officials, who act as regulators of an industry, to operate business in the same sector. </seg>
<seg id=14> Therefore, they can provide contracts, loans and favorable taxes to the businesses with their influences. </seg>
<seg id=15> This phenomenon undermines fair market competition and hampers China's transformation from a planned economy to a market one. </seg>
<seg id=16> It is reported that a newly-established committee under the State Council will take charge of over 500 largest former state-owned enterprises affiliated to the Party, governmental and law enforcement authorities. Their employees will be arranged by personnel departments. </seg>
<seg id=17> Local governments will take charge of the smaller-sized businesses. </seg>
<seg id=18> In addition, financial and investment companies will be controlled by the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> It is not clear now if these changes mean that the government will reduce its loans provided to the state-owned enterprises, causing some large-sized enterprises to gradually go bankrupt. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts believe that due to worries about the social instability caused by high unemployment rate, China is likely to deal with the problem of enterprises suffering losses by merger rather than bankruptcy. </seg>
