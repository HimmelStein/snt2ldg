</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP report from Detroit) The 107-year-old Hudson Building in Detroit turned into a heap of ruins in 30 seconds the day before yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> The reinforced structure building was 25 stories high, and was the highest building which was bombed down by plastic explosives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Hudson Building was once the largest retail store in the world, and was also a landmark of Detroit. </seg>
<seg id=5> With the explosion of 1,215 kilos of plastic explosives, the building turned into 306,000,000 kilos of debris at last. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> A series of internal explosions began in the Hudson Building at 5:45 p.m. local time, and cloud of dense dust turned into a thick fog which swallowed all the onlookers around. </seg>
<seg id=7> A citizen said, "I did not expect that I would be completely blackened by the dust." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> As the building collapsed, some onlookers cheered up, but some others were wiping their tears, as they would no longer see that familiar building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> During its peak time in the 50s, the building accommodated about 100,000 shoppers every day. </seg>
<seg id=10> Even some famous movie stars, including Garbo and Peck, visited the building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Mayor Archer of Detroit once told the public that the local authorities would like to offer to the public the chance to press the detonator in order to raise 150,000 US dollars of charity donations. </seg>
<seg id=12> But as the Hudson Building was the glory of Detroit, no one was willing to press the button to destroy the building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> A man who proposed to have the building under protection said, "It's a tragic thing." </seg>
