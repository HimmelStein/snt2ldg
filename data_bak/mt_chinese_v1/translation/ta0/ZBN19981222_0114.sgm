<seg id=1> Philippines Accuses Malaysia's Attempt to Occupy Its Reef </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Fernandel reports from Manila </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Philippine officials believed that apart from China another country which poses potential threats to the Philippines in the Nansha Islands is Malaysia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A Philippine intelligence file showed that Malaysian troops were attempting to occupy a reef of the Philippines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The file said Malaysia's attempt to occupy the reef might pose threats to Philippine's security because the reef was geographically close to Philippines' Barlawan Island. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The paper did not specify when the event took place or why the Malaysian troops' attempt did not succeed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Philippine military officials said in an earlier press interview that Malaysia's attempted to occupy the reef took place in August, or a few months before the Philippine Navy was aware of the Chinese Naval activities in the Meiji Reef in November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They explained that the timely "persuasion" by the Philippine government prevented Malaysia from carrying out its plan in that region, but the Philippine Defense Ministry officials did not give any details. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Before the Philippine military disclosed Malaysia's attempt to occupy the Philippine reef, President Estrada had rejected the proposals raised by the military to control the Philippine reefs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> In the same report, the military claimed China's construction of facilities in Meiji Reef as a springboard for the country to occupy the nearby Ledel Reef to prepare for its oil exploration. </seg>
