<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of January 18 from Abidjan (by staff reporter Linghu Daocheng) - Economy and Finance Minister Engoran of Cote d'Ivoire said here on the 17th that the member countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union have shown obvious recovery in economic growth, with major economic components in ideal conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Engoran said at a seminar of economists held at the Cote d'Ivoire Businessmen Club that the member states of the West African Economic and Monetary Union recorded annual average growth rates of 5.9% in 1996 and 6.3% in 1997, marking an obvious recovery from 2.6% in 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that the West African countries have in the past few years made great efforts in improving the situations of unbalanced import and export and of public investment, resulting in a marginal increase of trade surplus while considerably reducing their budgetary deficits, which only account for one third of their respective GDPs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> As to the effects on African francs caused by a unified European currency within the European Union, Engoran said that there is no need to worry about the future of African francs. </seg>
<seg id=6> He said that the member countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union have shown obvious recovery in their economic growth and there is no possibility that another marginal devaluation will occur to the African franc as in January of 1994 when the currency was devalued by 50%. </seg>
