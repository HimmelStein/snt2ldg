<seg id=1> Philippine Foreign Minister: Cambodia Not Expected to Join ASEAN Next Month </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (APF report from Manila) Philippine Foreign Minister Siazon said the day before yesterday that Cambodia was not expected to join ASEAN during the ASEAN summit next month in Hanoi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Siazon said Cambodia will not become an ASEAN member automatically even if the Cambodian opposition parties form a coalition before the summit meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "Many ASEAN members showed hesitation." </seg>
<seg id=5> "Now there still exist many problems and the political process in Cambodia is under way." </seg>
<seg id=6> "If we accept them as a new member, we have to deal with the problem once again if they fight again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Earlier this week, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah said Cambodia's ASEAN membership hinged on the establishment of a legitimate government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Siazon said, "Some say, haven't we been burnt before? At that time, just as we were ready to accept them, they fought again several days later." </seg>
<seg id=9> He was obviously referring to April 1997 when Cambodia was close to reach an agreement to join ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Cambodia's failure to join ASEAN was due to the overthrow of Prince Ranariddh by Hun Sen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Hun Sen's Cambodian Peoples' Party won the election in July but the party failed to win over 2/3 Parliament seats required for its sole control of the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen and Ranariddh reached an agreement to form a coalition government, but the new government is yet to be established. </seg>
