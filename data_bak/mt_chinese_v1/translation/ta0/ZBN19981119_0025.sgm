<seg id=1> Lien Hoe to Redeem the Remaining 65% of Bonds before the End of the Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Report from Kuala Lumpur) Lien Hoe expected that by way of bank loans, it may redeem the currently remaining 65% or 53,810,000 Ringgit of its bonds, before the end of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The redeemable secured bonds at an annual interest rate of 6% issued by Lien Hoe had a total value of 85,740,000 Ringgit, expiry on August 17, 1998. </seg>
<seg id=4> Due to the declining of the real estate market and the decrease of floating capital, Lien Hoe was able to redeem only 35% of its bonds upon expiration, and the remaining 65% of the bonds were deferred till August 17, 2000, at an annual interest rate of 15%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Securities Exchange Regulatory Commission granted its approval last month that Lien Hoe could defer its bonds till August 17, 2000, which made the Group the first company in the country to be approved for the deferral of bonds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> As the current market interest rate has gone down, Lien Hoe has planned to redeem the remaining bonds through bank loans, instead of the even higher annual interest rate to the bond holder, which is 15%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The managing director of the company, Tseng Hualong, said, as the current interest rate has gone down, and the newly proposed financial budget is advantageous to the development of the real estate industry, Lien Hoe was expected to be able to reverse the adverse situation in the first half of the year, and achieve good performance in the second half of the year. </seg>
