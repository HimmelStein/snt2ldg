<seg id=1> Delegates attending the UN Conference on World Climate continue their work in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id=2> Meanwhile, the US Congress is discussing whether or not to approve the Protocol reached in the Kyoto Conference in Japan. </seg>
<seg id=3> Another report filed by VOA correspondent Fulekus from Buenos Aires says several US Congressmen have brought the debate to the meeting hall of Buenos Aires on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id=4> Here is the detailed report read by Ma Kaiyue: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> US Democratic Senators Liberman and Kley announced their statement on Tuesday in Buenos Aires, urging the Clinton Administration to ratify the Protocol this week, which was reached at the Kyoto Conference. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two Senators said this will make US delegates more convincing in getting developing countries to promise to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id=7> This is actually a precondition set for several bills in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some US Congressmen in Buenos Aires said they opposed any such actions taken by the Clinton Administration. </seg>
<seg id=9> Chairman of the House Science Committee, Wisconsin Republican S.S. Brunne said the Kyoto Protocol is sure to be vetoed in the Senate due to its fatal defects. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Congressman S.S. Brunne said that just as the Protocol is being put aside right now, it would have become defunct before getting to the Senate, and the US Senate will not approve the Protocol. </seg>
<seg id=12> The question is what we should do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> Shall we try to save it or to declare that the Protocol has fatal defects and we need to hold another discussion. </seg>
<seg id=14> Congressman S.S. Brunne said this is not a Party struggle in the Senate and the Congress, which was echoed by several prominent Democratic Congress members. </seg>
<seg id=15> Pennsylvanian Democratic Congressman Kellink said he was opposed to the Protocol because it would reduce the employment rate and the degree of US industrialization. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Ohio Democratic Congressman Kuczyn disagreed with S.S. Brunne. He compared the fight against global warming with the struggle for world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said the same resolution will make the Kyoto Protocol a success. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> Congressman Kuczyn said, I hope this process to go on and at the same time we cannot ignore the necessity of reaching a global solution simply because of the stubbornness of one Congressman, with or without the US participation. </seg>
<seg id=20> In the main meeting hall of Buenos Aires, delegates are discussing various topics, some of which will most probably be left to energy and environmental ministers of 160 attending countries to settle during Wednesday's meeting. </seg>
<seg id=21> US delegates said the conference has made headway though some issues, although some issues most concerned for by the US Congress will probably be left for settlement till next year's conference. </seg>
