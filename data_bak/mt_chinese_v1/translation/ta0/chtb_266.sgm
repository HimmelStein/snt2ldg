<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of August 31 from Jerusalem (by staff reporter Huai Chengbo) - The Jerusalem Posts today cited Savel, director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry General Office now visiting in the US as saying that the World Bank has decided to offer a US$2.5 billion aid to Palestine before the end of 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The decision has broken the ice between the donor countries and the Palestinian autonomous government, that has lasted for nearly a year. </seg>
<seg id=4> At an international meeting held on October 1 last year in Washington in support of Palestinian autonomy, the donor nations guaranteed that they will offer a US$2.4 billion development aid within five years, of which US$750 million will be provided during the first year. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, the donor nations claimed that there is a lack of necessary mechanism and accounting books for the handling of the aid fund in the Palestinian autonomous region. Therefore, they refused to fully fulfill this undertaking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Savel said that although the US and the World Bank are not fully satisfied with the accounting work in Palestine, they have agreed to make a partial payment of this aid fund as soon as possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> PLO Executive Chairman Arafat and other Palestinian leaders have always criticized that the donor nations have failed to fulfill their undertakings in making the aid funds available in a timely manner. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is anticipated that PLO chief negotiator Shaarh and Israeli chief negotiator Rosschild will head for Washington and discuss with the US and the World Bank regarding the aid fund issue. </seg>
