</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur)Malaysian Information Minister Mohammed Rahmat said people who took part in the "Lasting Peace" demonstrations should not become foreign puppets to sabotage the country and should, instead, take wiser approaches to express their wills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said that compared with resorting to violence and making chaos, it is much more effective to express their wills through reasonable means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Malaysian News Agency reported that Mohammed Rahmat told reporters yesterday after attending Information Ministry's Home Day activities that the government had taken measures to allow the people to fully express their wills in 500 Expression Centers established across the country such that all people can express their opinions and views toward the country through proper channels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said the government will study the opinions and wills of the people and make improvements to meet the needs of the people. </seg>
<seg id=6> He stressed that this is a practice of democratic nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He also urged the demonstrators to think thoroughly about the consequences of demonstrations because Malaysia's prosperity today is the result of contributions of all Malaysians and active construction during the past 41 years following its independence. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He said, "If foreigners want to invest in Malaysia, we welcome but if they pay the demonstrators, we certainly will protest." </seg>
