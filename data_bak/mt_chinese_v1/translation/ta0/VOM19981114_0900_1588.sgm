<seg id=2> In the United States, California and other southern states were flooded at the beginning of this year, followed by a drought in many places in the south. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Chicago, which usually has freezing winters, witnessed warmer weather and less snow last year and the next winter is likely to be the same. </seg>
<seg id=7> Meanwhile, El Nino was rampant in Southeast Asia with a drastic decrease of precipitation, causing wild fire that has lasted for weeks and been out of control. </seg>
<seg id=8> The El Nino and La Nina are the results of drastic temperature changes in the eastern Pacific Ocean. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino refers to the above-average temperatures of the water's surface, which affects the air current causing changes of world weather. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nina refers to the below-average temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean's surface, which has the opposite influences on the weathers of many places. </seg>
<seg id=11> Larve, an expert with the U.S. Meteorological Bureau, said that big fires in Indonesia will not go out of control next year because the region is predicted to see more rain from this December to next March compared with the previous years. </seg>
<seg id=12> Meanwhile, western and southeastern Africa will see lower temperatures and there will be more rain in the northern part of South America. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern part of the United States will be drier, which means Taxes and New Mexico will experience persistent drought while there are more chances of fire taking place in the forests of Florida. </seg>
<seg id=14> The torrential rain this year in California and its southern part is attributed to the El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Larve said the El Nino will not result in rainstorms but will contribute to the forming of them. </seg>
<seg id=16> The past summer was one of the hottest in the history of the United States. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some people link the world warming to the El Nino Phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id=18> Larve believes that it is possible but there has been no evidence so far. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, whatever the reason is, the upcoming winter in the north and central west will be much colder and will see more snow. </seg>
