<seg id=3> It is anticipated that the annual total foreign trade volume will exceed US$9 billion. </seg>

<seg id=4> This year, Pudong New Area saw balanced and powerful increases in both import and export trade. </seg>
<seg id=5> Processing trade underwent relatively rapid development. Over 200 State-owned enterprises in Pudong have engaged in the processing trade, gaining an equal share of the business with foreign-funded enterprises both in terms of the number of enterprises and the amount of contractual investment. Moreover, the mode of production and operation is changing from the simple processing of client-supplied materials to the deep and fine processing of high-technology and high value-added products. </seg>

<seg id=6> According to the relevant sources, the foreign-funded enterprises in Pudong New Area recorded an import and export trade volume of 3.86 billion this year, marking an increase of 37.4% over the corresponding period last year and accouting for 45% of Pudong's total foreign trade volume. This is because some foreign-funded enterprises increased their import of equipment as equity investment and Pudong took the lead in China in opening its foreign trade business to foreign investment. Three Chinese-foreign equity joint venture trade companies have been established as a result. </seg>
