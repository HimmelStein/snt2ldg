</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Reuters report from Washington) Vice Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Rivlin warned on Monday that the global financial crisis will slow down US economic growth, and hinted that the United States may need to further cut interest rates to avoid economic recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Rivlin said in an interview that she didn't think the US economy would collapse but she warned that the decline of export and the reduction of employment opportunities mean that economic growth would slow down drastically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Federal Reserve had cut interest rates twice over the past six weeks to avoid the lash on US economy brought by the most severe financial crisis in half a century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet on November 17 to discuss about interest rate cut. </seg>
<seg id=6> It is generally anticipated that the Federal Reserve will cut rates again to keep the economy stable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The US economy saw a 3.3% increase in the third quarter of the year, lower than the 5.5% of the firs quarter. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is predicted that the economy will further slow down in the coming several months. </seg>
<seg id=9> This is because both investment and output of the American manufacturing industry have been affected by the decline of US export to Asia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Rivlin pointed out that the great pressure on the US financial market had been relieved in the past few weeks. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, she warned that the credit crunch still existed. </seg>
