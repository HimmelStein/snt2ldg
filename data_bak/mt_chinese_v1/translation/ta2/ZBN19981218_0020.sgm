<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur) According to Deputy Finance Minister of Malaysia, Wong See Wah, foreign exchange control measures are due to expire on September 1 next year (after put into force for one full year).  It is estimated that about 10 billion Malaysian Ringgit of foreign capitals may withdraw from the stock market.  Therefore, the government will adopt different measures to create a favorable investment environment in order to encourage foreign capitals to continue their stay in Malaysia. </seg>

<seg id=3> Judging from the economic growth in the third quarter, Malaysia's economy has already showed some signs of recovery and hence, the economy should be more stable by next September, he said.  When the market becomes actively again, foreign businessmen may decide to invest in Malaysia again. </seg>

<seg id=5> He stressed that the Malaysian government has decided to fix the exchange rate of 1 U.S. Dollars to 3.8 Malaysian Ringgit.  The measure enables investors to do some long term planning about their investment.  Investors do not need to worry about fluctuations in exchange rates and can make a more accurate investment decision. </seg>
