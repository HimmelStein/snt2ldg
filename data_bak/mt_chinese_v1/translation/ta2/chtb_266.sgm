<seg id=1> World Bank decided to provide US$ 250 million aids to Palestinian </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A report in the "Jerusalem Mail" today quoted Savilian, Director of Foreign Affairs Department of Israel, as saying that World Bank decided to grant US$ 250 million aids to Palestinian Self-rule Organization before the end of 1994. Savilian is currently in U.S. on visit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This decision broke the impasse for nearly one year between donor countries and the Palestinian Self-rule Organization. </seg>
<seg id=4> During an international conference on Palestinian aids held October 1 last year in Washington, the donor countries undertook to provide US$ 2.4 billion development aids to Palestinian within a period of five years.  It was further agreed that the aids in the first year would not be less than US$ 570 million. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, the donor countries are of the opinion that the Palestinian self-rule region does not have the necessary systems to handle the aids and the accounting thereof.  Therefore, they refused to fully perform their undertaking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Savilian said that both U.S. and World Bank are still not fully satisfied with the accounting work in the Palestinian self-rule areas.  Nevertheless, they agreed that part of the funds should be paid as soon as possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Arafat, Chairman of Executive Committee, Palestinian Liberation Organization as well as other leaders of Palestinians have been criticizing the donor countries for failure to perform their undertaking and provide the funds on time. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is expected that the chief negotiator of Palestinian Liberation Organization and the chief negotiator of Israel will go to Washington and discuss with U.S. and World Bank about specific implementation details of the aid package. </seg>
