<seg id=2> Gu Yongjiang indicated that China's economic development brings five important opportunities to Hong Kong Special Administrative Zone and they are: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> -- Help ensure long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong's economy </seg>
<seg id=4> China's economy is growing steadily over a long period of time and Hong Kong economy can benefit from a dynamic economy in China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> -- Can provide more commerce opportunities to Hong Kong </seg>
<seg id=6> After China systematically opens its service sectors, including domestic trades, financial services and retail services etc., Hong Kong's service industries will have greater rooms for development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> -- Help strength Hong Kong's position as a trade and shipping center </seg>
<seg id=8> China's total foreign export is likely to reach US$ 800 billion by the year of 2010.  This will no doubt increase the demands for transit and transshipment services in Hong Kong, which can strength Hong Kong's position as a trading and shipping center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> -- Promote further developments in Hong Kong's financial markets </seg>
<seg id=10> As the reform of state-owned enterprises intensify, there will be more joint stock enterprises seeking a public listing outside China.  Hong Kong will be the first choice for state-owned enterprise seeking a foreign listing. </seg>
<seg id=11> This will in turn enlarge the size of Hong Kong's stock market, enhance market structure and facilitate the development of bond markets in Hong Kong.  There will also be more China funds in Hong Kong.  All these will strengthen and enhance Hong Kong position as a financial center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> -- help improve the competitive position of Hong Kong's products in International markets </seg>
<seg id=13> China and Hong Kong can work on a complementary economic relationship such that the advantageous positions of two economies can be combined.  This will greatly improve the competitive position of Hong Kong's products in international markets. </seg>
