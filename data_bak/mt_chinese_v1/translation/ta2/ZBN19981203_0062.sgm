<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, Sydney) A survey released yesterday discovered that several thousands of British immigrants left Australia because of the "hate Britain psychology" and the discrimination against them by local people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The British Immigrants Association urged the Government to face the problem for the benefit of local immigrants and also for Australia's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Many British are of the opinion that Australians have "hate Britain psychology", the Chairman of the Association pointed out.  This may cause the Australian economy to lose several million dollars each year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Chairman said that it is disappointing to see so many British leaving Australia.  Most of them are skilled workers and are usually financially independent as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told the reporter, "According to the immigration rules here, they are not the type of immigrants that you want to get rid of". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Fourteen percent of the Australia population is British. </seg>
<seg id=8> Statistic by the Immigration Office indicated an arrival of 11,978 British immigrants during 1996 to 1997 but 3,737 British immigrants left in the same period of time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> "The Association conducted a survey in Melbourne using its own resources and found that one-fourth of all British believe they are being discriminated in Australia", he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 40% of the interviewed thought local people show an undue favor towards non-British. </seg>
<seg id=11> While 37% pointed out that the complaints by British immigrants are not dealt with as seriously as complaints from other ethnic groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Approximately 35% of the interviewed blamed the media for causing the prejudice against British immigrants in Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Keating, former Prime Minister of Australia, also has anti-British standpoint and hence not a good example to the locals, he said. </seg>
