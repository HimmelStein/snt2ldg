</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Associated Press, Lisbon) Portugal attorney general's office said the day before yesterday that it is examining a member of parliament's request to extradite the former Indonesian President Suharto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Nuno Correia da Silva, a member of parliament, said in a letter that Suharto should be extradited for his violations of human rights in East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=4> Indonesia invaded the Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed East Timor after several weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "We are studying whether it is possible to do so in Portuguese law", said Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Human rights groups have accused Indonesian troops of numerous violations of human rights in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Correia da Silva said that the recent attempt to extradite former Chilean dictator Pinochet to Spain for charges including genocide has strengthened his determination to extradite Suharto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Pinochet is currently in London awaiting a House of Lords decision on his extradition. </seg>
<seg id=9> The British Supreme Court rescinded the original arrest warrant against Pinochet on the grounds that Pinochet entitles to immunity from prosecution as a former chief of state. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Correia da Silva is a member of Portugal's right wing Popular Party. </seg>
<seg id=11> United Nations still regards Portugal as the legitimate administrative power in East Timor and this should help the request to extradite Suharto, he said. </seg>
