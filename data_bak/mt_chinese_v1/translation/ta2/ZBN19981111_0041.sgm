<p>
<seg id=2> (Reuters, Washington) U.S. Federal Reserve Board vice chairman Rivlin warned on Monday that the global financial crisis might cause a significant slowdown in U.S. economy.  She hinted that U.S. might need more interest cuts in order to avoid an economic recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> She did not think the U.S. economy is going to collapse, Rivlin said during an interview.  However, she warned that export volume may drop and poor job opportunities may mean a significant slowdown in the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Federal Reserve Board cut interest rate twice in the past 6 weeks in an attempt to minimize the impacts to U.S. economy because of the most serious financial crisis in the past 50 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Federal Reserve's next meeting is on November 17 and will discuss whether it is appropriate to cut interest rate again. </seg>
<seg id=6> Most people guess the Board will favor another cut to stabilize the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> U.S. third quarter growth is 3.3%, which is lower than the 5.5% recorded in first quarter. </seg>
<seg id=8> Most forecasts anticipate a further slow down in the economy in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id=9> This is because U.S. is likely to export less to Asia and hence causes an impact to investment and production volume in the manufacturing sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Rivlin pointed out that the massive pressure on U.S. financial markets had slightly reduced in the past several weeks. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, she warned that there still appears to be a credit squeeze. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> According to Rivlin, the world economy has not shrugged off the crisis completely. </seg>
<seg id=13> The recovery in Asia is still in the preliminary stage. </seg>
<seg id=14> The economy in Japan, the world's second largest economy, has not fully recovered while the economic situation in Russia is "still bad". </seg>
