</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, Manila) Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said the day before yesterday that Cambodia has no hope to join ASEAN in the coming ASEAN summit to be held in Hanoi next month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Even if the opposing parties in Cambodia manage to form a coalition government before the summit, Cambodia will not automatically become a member of ASEAN, Siazon said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "Many ASEAN members are still undecided. </seg>
<seg id=5> There are many questions at this moment.  Cambodia's political development is still in progress. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we admit them as a new member but then they start to fight again, we will have to solve the problem again". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Earlier this week, Malaysia Foreign Minister Addullah said that the issue of Cambodia's accession to ASEAN is hinged on whether Cambodia can successful form a legitimate government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "Someone said that we have been burnt once, aren't we?  At that time, we are prepared to accept them but they started to fight again a few days later", Siazon said. </seg>
<seg id=9> He is referring to the April 1997 incident.  At that time, Cambodia was nearly admitted to ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> However, Hun Sen used force to overturn Prince Ranariddh and Cambodia's accession to ASEAN turned bubble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Hun Sen's Cambodia People's Party won the election in July this year but failed to secure the required two-thirds of the seats to form a single party government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen and Ranariddh made an agreement to form a coalition government but the new government is not established at this moment. </seg>
