<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 23 (reporter: Liu Yaming) - Recently, the related experts and scholars found a large number of fossils of dinosaur bones at Yangcheng Xiang, Xixia Xian, Henan province. </seg>
<seg id=3> This is another important discovery in the area after the discovery of many valuable fossils of dinosaur eggs last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> At the beginning of April this year, the related experts found several hundred pieces of fossils of dinosaur bones between two gravel layers in a river at Hutou Shan, Yangcheng Xiang, Xixia Xian.  The fossils included rib and phalanx of a dinosaur. </seg>
<seg id=5> Some of the fossils are already broken because of exposure near the surface of the earth for a long time. </seg>
<seg id=6> According to stratigraphy, the fossils belong to the Cretaceous period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> According to expert's estimation, there should still be large quantities of fossils of dinosaur bones and probably fossils of other species as well hidden beneath the earth in the fossil spread-out-area. </seg>
<seg id=8> They thought that the discovery of large quantities of valuable fossil dinosaur eggs in Xixia basin is a rare event in the world and the presence of eggs and bones together is even more rare. </seg>
<seg id=9> The discovery is important to the research and classification of dinosaurs in Xixia regions.  It is helpful to the exploration of ecological habits and breeding behavior of dinosaurs.  The ability to reproduce the ecosystem prevailing in the dinosaur era has very important meaning -- it can reveal changes occurred in earth crust and related evolution pattern in our environment. </seg>
<seg id=10> The discovery also provides an important clue to the geographic location pattern and can aid future dinosaur discovery works. </seg>
