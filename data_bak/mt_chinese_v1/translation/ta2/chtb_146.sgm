<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 6 (reporter: Zhou Xisheng) - In his speech during a luncheon held by National Committee on U.S.-China Relations on the 6th, James Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, appealed to U.S. for a more constructive policy towards China.  He asked U.S. to "use strategic judgment, adopt a credible, consistent and constructive policy towards China"; use complete and candid dialogue to resolve differences on some problems with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Sasser pointed out that U.S. should properly face China's emerge in the international political stage.  It does not matter whether it is the end of this century or in the next century; U.S. should develop a stable and healthy relation with China and this will be an important challenge and opportunity in foreign policy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> On the question of human right and protection of intellectual property in China, the ambassador pointed out that China has made leaps in these two areas. </seg>
<seg id=5> He thought that the Chinese people are now enjoying more freedom and democracy than before.  China has also adopted a positive and cooperating attitude towards the protection of intellectual property.  U.S. should not ignore these developments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In addition, James Sasser advocated that U.S. Congress should cancel the annual debate on the renewal of the China's most favored nation status after China's accession to World Trade Organization.  China should be granted permanent most favored nation status. </seg>
<seg id=7> He pointed out that a U.S. congress debate each year is actually not working in the interest of U.S.  It affects U.S. businesses' confidence to make investments in China, which in turn affect the creation of jobs in U.S. </seg>
