<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, Lisbon) According to reliable information, Portugal Foreign Minister Gama is going to meet an official of United Nations in Vienna tomorrow to discuss the report of excessive Indonesian troops in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The spokesman for Gama said that the subject of the related report is inconsistent with the guarantee made by Indonesia Foreign Minister Alatas to United Nations Secretary General Annan in August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesman said that Alatas did guarantee a gradual reduction of Indonesian troops in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Information sources revealed that Gama is going to discuss the relevant development with a special envoy of Annan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to some documents, which appear to be classified documents of the Indonesian army, now circulating among foreign correspondents, the number of Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor was 17,834 men as at end of July this year. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to a western embassy, this number is quite close to their estimate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> However, the commander-in-chief of Indonesian armed force, General Wiranto, said that the number of seventeen thousand is a "lie". </seg>
<seg id=9> However, he did not disclose the actual number.  According to a military official, there were about fifteen thousand soldiers stationed in East Timor in mid-August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Indonesia dispatched troops to East Timor in 1975 and annexed it in the following year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> However, United Nations still regards Lisbon as the legitimate administrative power in East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=12> The Secretary General of United Nations has been sponsoring peace talks between Portugal and Indonesia since 1983. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> East Timor's leaders, including Belo, a Nobel prize recipient, and Ramos-Horta, East Timor Independence guerrilla leader, who is still in prison at moment, issued pubic statements to support the related report and retorted Jakarta's claim of troops reduction in East Timor. </seg>
