<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 21 - City infrastructures used to be a burden in any appeal to foreign capitals.  Nevertheless, foreign businessmen have adopted a more positive view on it.  City infrastructure becomes a new area for intense foreign capital utilization in Qinghai, ranking just after the resources exploitation sector. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> For a very long time, the construction of city infrastructure in Xining Shi suffered from insufficient investment.  In the 46 years from the formation of the new China up till 1995, the total investment was only RMB 400 million.  The backward city constructions have restricted economic development. </seg>
<seg id=4> During the past two years, a batch of foreign businessmen expressed their wishes to get involved in Xining's city construction one after another. </seg>
<seg id=5> The Qinghai provincial government made beneficial use of the situation and brought up the idea of city construction through commercialization of city infrastructures.  At the beginning of this year, the provincial government approved "Certain regulations in the encouragement and guidance to foreign investments in Xining Shi". </seg>

<seg id=7> The Mojia Street project, an old city renovation, is designed in full compliance with functional requirements of a modern city.  A Hong Kong merchant will invest RMB 50 million and becomes the sole contractor of the project. </seg>
<seg id=8> The new number six water source works utilize nearly RMB 20 million in foreign capital. The project can supply 150 thousand tons of water each day and will substantially improve the water shortage situation in Xining Shi. </seg>
<seg id=9> An agreement has been reached with Hong Kong based Tai Hua Company for the construction of exit roads at the north end of the city.
