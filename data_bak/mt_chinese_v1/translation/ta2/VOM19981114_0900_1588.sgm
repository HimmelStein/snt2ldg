<seg id=1> We already know the effect of climate changes.  The consequences of El Nino phenomenon last year included a huge continuous fire in Indonesia; flooding in barren desert area in Peru; and serious climate abnormity in extensive areas around the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> For example, there were flooding in California and other southern U.S. states earlier this year and droughts occurred afterwards in many areas in the south. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to experts, El Nino is turning into a new phenomenon, which is called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> It is likely that La Nina will cause a new series of astonishing weather phenomenon next year that is comparable to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Please listen to the report from Li Lan, Voice of America Chicago.  Qi Zhifeng is making news at this hour. </seg>

<seg id=6> Chicago used to have freezing winters.  However, last year was much warmer than the years before.  Snowfall was lower than before and next winter may also be something similar. </seg>
<seg id=7> Meanwhile, El Nino was also raging in Southeast Asia.  Rainfall decreased and drought caused bush fires that were out of control for weeks. </seg>
<seg id=8> El Nino and La Nina are the results of significant changes in sea surface temperature in East tropical Pacific. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino refers to sea surface temperature that is much higher than normal.  This affects the airflow and wind, which in turn causes changes in climates in different parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nina refers to the sea surface temperature that is lower than normal in tropical Pacific.  This will cause weather effects that are opposite to El Nino in different parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id=11> Lafu, an expert of U.S. State Climatology Office, said that there may not be any out of control fire in Indonesia next year because rainfall in that area from December this year to March next year is forecasted to be more than last year. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time, the average temperature in Western Africa and Southeast Africa is a bit lower than normal while the northern part of South America may have more than average rains. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern part of U.S. will be drier.  This may mean continuous drought in Texas and New Mexico while the chance of a forest fire in Florida is higher than normal. </seg>
<seg id=14> El Nino has also caused torrential rains in California and in the southern part of the States this year. </seg>
<seg id=15> Lafu said that El Nino does not produce torrential rains itself but it creates conditions that facilitate the formation of serious rainstorm. </seg>
<seg id=16> This year, U.S. has the hottest summer ever known in history. </seg>
<seg id=17> Many people have linked El Nino phenomenon to global warming. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lafu thought that such association is possible but there is no way to prove it at this moment. </seg>
<seg id=19> No matter what the reason may be, it probably means the coming winters in north and central western areas of U.S. will be one colder than the other.  It is also sure that we will have more snow in winters. </seg>
