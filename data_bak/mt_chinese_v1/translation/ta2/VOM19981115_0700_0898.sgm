<seg id=4> As the curtain of darkness arrived, troops tried to disperse those young men throwing stones at soldiers in the Chinatown areas by firing their guns as warning. </seg>
<seg id=5> A few hours ago, several thousands of people gathered before a bank, which is not more than one kilometer from the President's palace.  The mob set fire on the bank, which soon spread to nearby shops. </seg>
<seg id=6> A group of young men forced open the shop gate with the pole of the street lamp. </seg>
<seg id=7> On Saturday, attacks were targeted at the Chinese.  A crown dragged a Chinese to the street, beat him up and threw him into a water channel. </seg>
<seg id=8> Troops arrived in an armed troop carrier and saved the seriously wounded man. </seg>

<seg id=10> Merchants selling electrical goods there had relocated their shops after the riot in May. </seg>
<seg id=11> The reporter came across a young man (29 years old) with the family name Min.  He was wearing only shorts and a belt while guarding behind a roadblock made of wire meshes </seg>
<seg id=12> This young man, working for a computer company, together with his Muslim neighbor were protecting the area throughout the night in order to keep the mobs away from their homes. </seg>
