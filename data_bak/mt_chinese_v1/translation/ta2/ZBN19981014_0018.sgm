<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, Bangkok) Thailand's Ministry of Transport announced yesterday that Thailand is making a demand to the main contractor, Hopewell Group (publicly listed in Hong Kong), seeking a damage of US$ 680 million (approximately 110 million Singapore Dollars) for Hopewell's failure to complete the elevated railway and highway system within the contracted time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Phataraprasit, deputy transport minister of Thailand said that Thailand Ministry of Transport and the State Railway of Thailand have recourse against Hopewell Group for delays in the project for the amount of US$ 680 million.  Thailand criticizes Hopewell Group, which managed to complete only 12% of the planned works in the past eight years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hopewell Group made several negotiations with Thailand Authorities since the economic crisis in Thailand, which devaluated the Thai Baht and intensified financial disputes between the two sides.  The two sides also talked about progress in expropriation of lands but no conclusion has been reached.  As a result, Thailand Government terminated Hopewell's contract in January this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> For this reason, Hopewell Group already demanded the Thailand Government to pay the company damages to the amount of 100 billion Baht (about 4.2 billion Singapore Dollars) to compensate the company for capital investments and work done in the past eight years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Thailand is planning to revive the project, estimated to cost US$ 3.2 billion, but may cut down the size of the project, Thailand Government said yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=7> In any event, Hopewell Group will not be allowed to participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Phataraprasit said that the German Government and German Development Bank (KFW) have some interests in this massive project and decided to provide 100 million Baht to do a feasibility study on Bangkok's elevated railway and highway project. </seg>

<seg id=9> Siemens of Germany is currently co-operating with a Thailand company to lay 23 kilometers of tracks for an electrical railway in Bangkok. </seg>
