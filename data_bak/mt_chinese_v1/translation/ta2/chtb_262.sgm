</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The size and shape of this piece of yuhua stone resembles a mascot in the civic world, the long life lock. </seg>
<seg id=4> There is a clear image of the domain of the People's Republic of China in the middle of the yuhua stone. </seg>
<seg id=5> The two sides of image are raised while the middle is recessed.  The bottom of the right side is protruded as if it is a sounding rooster with its chest thrust out.   Next to the belly of the "rooster" and separated by a piece of "strait" is a long narrow "Taiwan Island".  Beneath the claw of the "rooster" is the round "Hainan Island". </seg>
<seg id=6> The color and luster of the two "islands" are the same as the "mainland". </seg>

<seg id=8> Professor Liu Yuyi said that he got the stone from a yuhua stone-processing factory in suburb area of Nanjing about five years ago.  When he got home, he found the "domain of China" after detail examination of the stone. </seg>
<seg id=9> At the same time, he also found a giant dragon with a pearl in its mouth, which entrenched from northeast, north China to the northwest border, in the upper part of the domain of China.  Above the giant dragon is a golden facular in the shape of a gold ingot.  In the middle part of the China domain, there are stripes that look like a series of torches, a symbol for the never-burnt-out spiritual fire of the Chinese People.  In addition, the rock has the shape of a long life lock and hence a total of five distinguishing features. </seg>
