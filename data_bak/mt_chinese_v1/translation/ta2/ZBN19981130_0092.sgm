<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur) Malaysia Information Minister Mohamad Rahmat said that people taking part in the "Raging fire never die" movement should be careful not to become a puppet of foreign power and help destroy their own country.  They should use more sensible means to express their wishes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said that people should use rational ways to express their thoughts, which are more effective than methods employing violence and chaos. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> As reported by Malaysia National News Agency, Mohamad Rahmat indicated to media, after joining the Ministry of Information's family day activities, that the government has already adopted measures to let people express their thoughts.  Malaysia will set up 500 "make a statement center" in different parts of Malaysia.  People can use this proper channel to express their views and opinions about their country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The government will study the opinions and thoughts of the people and try the best to improve itself such as to meet the widespread need of the people. </seg>
<seg id=6> He stressed that this is the normal way in a democratic country. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=9> "If foreigners want to come and invest in Malaysia, we always welcome them.  If they pay money to demonstrators, we will certainly protest", he said. </seg>
