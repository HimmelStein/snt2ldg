<seg id=1> First, Let's look at Canada in below. </seg>
<seg id=2> Sergio Marchi, Minister of International Trade of Canada indicated that Canada should export its own concept of values in tandem with the export of trades and products.  This can help improve human right in China as well as other Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id=3> Marchi made the point in response to the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs' suggestion that trades should be tied with human rights </seg>
<seg id=4> Please listen to Yan Ming's report, Voice of America Toronto. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> Canada Minister of International Trade, Marchi, made a very positive response to the suggestion detailed in a report by the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, which says trades should be tied with human rights. </seg>
<seg id=6> Marchi said that Canada should incorporate a new factor, that is human rights, into Canada's foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to the newspaper, Ottawa Citizen, Minister of International Trade Marchi said the above words during a meeting on foreign affairs and international trades in Ottawa on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id=8> Marchi also indicated that from what he saw whilst attending the APEC summit meeting in Malaysia and then the arrest of dissidents by Chinese Authorities in recent days, he firmly believes Canada should export its own values in tandem with export of its products.  It does not matter whether the export is a provision of economic aid or the export is an international trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> According to Marchi, Human rights and social justice should be made important contents in Canada's foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Canadian Press said that the report from the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs suggested the Canadian Government to re-examine different types of foreign aids such as to ensure local human right status can be improved simultaneously with any economic development in the receiving country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to the Globe and Mail, all sorts of signs indicated that the Canadian Government is attempting to adjust its foreign policy, including policy towards China and other Asian countries.  The Standing Senate Committee report is only one of the many signals. </seg>
<seg id=12> On Thursday, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, expressed high concern to China's arrest of dissidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> "We must make a response to this matter", He said. </seg>
<seg id=14> "We have already pointed out to the Chinese Government - arrest of people with different political views violates the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </seg>
<seg id=15> According to Canadian Press, Canada has not made any open criticism against China for more than two years.  However, Canada Prime Minister Jean Chretien completely abandoned the practice and criticized China's human rights records several times in open occasions during his visit to China last month. </seg>
<seg id=16> The Canadian Prime Minister's unusual course of action actually illustrated that Canada is making changes to its foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> According to a report in the Globe and Mail, Canadian commercial sectors have different opinions towards Marchi's position of supporting a tie between trades and human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> Many are worrying privately that such a tie may affect the business of large Canadian enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=19> Nevertheless, Zhu Yuchao, Ph. D., of Okanagan University College, British Columbia, has a different view: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> "As far as North America capitalists are concerned, investors may go and invest in Southeast Asia.  They can build factory there and they can do trading there.  The most important reason is to make money.  True, they need to make a profit. </seg>
<seg id=21> However, when they enter these Southeast countries, they can bring some standards to these countries with them.  For example, in the area of labor protection, they can introduce labor protection concepts and standards of fringe benefits etc. to these countries.  In addition, they can bring environmental requirements as well.  All these will benefit both sides to the deal. </seg>
<seg id=22> Furthermore, the person introducing these concepts plays a demonstration role.  He can help improve the human rights in that country.  Labor rights are concepts that are easy to understand and yet such concepts can have a very direct impact to human rights. </seg>
