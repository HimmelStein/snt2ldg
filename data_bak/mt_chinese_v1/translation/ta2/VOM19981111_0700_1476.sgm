<seg id=1> The delegates continue their works at the United Nations Global Climate Talks in Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina </seg>
<seg id=2> Meanwhile, U.S. Congress is also debating whether last year's Kyoto (Japan) agreement is to be approved or not. </seg>
<seg id=3> Another report from Voice of America's correspondent in Buenos Aires: On Tuesday, several members of U.S. Congress brought the Kyoto debate to the meeting hall in Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id=4> Please listen to the details of the story.  Ma Kaiyue is making news this hour. </seg>

<seg id=5> On Tuesday, U.S. Congress, Democratic Sen. Lieberman and Kerry made a statement in Buenos Aires.  They will urge the Clinton Administration to sign and approve the accord arrived at the Kyoto meeting this week. </seg>
<seg id=6> Both Senators indicated that the approval could enhance the persuasiveness of U.S. delegates and cause developing countries to make a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </seg>
<seg id=7> This is actually the essential condition brought up in the past several bills by the Senate. </seg>
<seg id=8> Nevertheless, some House Representatives in Buenos Aires said that they are in opposition of any approval by the Clinton Administration. </seg>
<seg id=9> The Republican House Science Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-Wisconsin) said that the Kyoto agreement has fatal defects and will definitely be vetoed by U.S. Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sensenbrenner said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> "The agreement is currently put aside and it will be dead on arrival the Senate.  U.S. Senate will never approve such an agreement. </seg>
<seg id=12> The question is what can we do now? </seg>
<seg id=13> Should we try to save it or should we announce the agreement has fatal defects and a new debate is necessary." </seg>
<seg id=14> Rep. James Sensenbrenner said that the issue is not a fight between the two parties either in U.S. Senate or in U.S. House of Representatives.  Several famous Democratic Congress members also agreed. </seg>
<seg id=15> Democratic Rep. Ron Klink (R-Pennsylvania) said that he is against the accord because it will reduce job opportunities and cause a de-industrialization in U.S. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant (R-Ohio) did not agree with Sensenbrenner's view.  He took the global warming phenomenon and compares it as war and peace in the world. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said the same determination could ensure a victory for the Kyoto accord. </seg>
<seg id=18> Traficant said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> "I hope the process can continue and we cannot ignore the necessity to reach a global solution just because of a certain stubborn Congress member.  It should continue with or without the participation of U.S. Congress". </seg>
<seg id=20> In the main conference hall in Buenos Aires, delegates are discussing different types of questions.  However, it is likely that many of these questions have to be left to Wednesday's meeting and to be solved by the Resources and Environmental Ministers of the 160 participating countries. </seg>
<seg id=21> The U.S. delegates said that some issues of concern to U.S. Congress might have to be delayed to next meeting for solutions.  Nevertheless, this meeting has achieved some progress. </seg>
