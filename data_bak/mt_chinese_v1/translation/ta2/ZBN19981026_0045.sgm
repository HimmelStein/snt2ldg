<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, Detroit) The 107 years old Hudson's Building was reduced to a pile of rubble in 30 seconds the day before yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> This steel bar reinforced building was 25 stories high and is the tallest building that can be demolished by plastic explosive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hudson's Building was once the world's largest retail shop and a landmark of Detroit downtown. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the midst of loud explosions produced by the 1215 kilograms of plastic explosive, the building finally turned into 360 million kilograms of rubble. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At 5:45 pm local time, a series of inward explosion started at the Hudson's Building.  The dense and thick dust turned into a huge cloud, which totally covered the surrounding spectators. </seg>
<seg id=7> "I never thought that I would be made completely black because of the dust", one citizen said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> When the building fell, some spectators shouted in joy while some spectators cried because they can never see this familiar building again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> At its peak in mid-1950s, more than 100 thousand people did their shopping at Hudson's Building everyday. </seg>
<seg id=10> At that time, some famous movie stars, including Garbo and Parker, also shopped there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> The Detroit Mayor Archer indicated that the authorities were willing to provide the public with the opportunity to operate the detonator in return for a charity donation of 150 thousand U.S. dollars. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, Hudson's Building is an old glory of Detroit and no one is willing to push the detonator and destroy the building with his or her own hand. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=13> "This is a tragic event", a man, who advocates protection of the building, said. </seg>
