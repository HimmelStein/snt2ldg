<seg id=1> A U.S. arms-control delegation is in Beijing and they want China to join the Missile Technology Control Regime as soon as possible.  China may be exporting missile technology to other countries at this moment. </seg>
<seg id=2> Please listen to the following comprehensive report by Voice of America reporter, Fang Yuan: </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> A group of U.S. officials, led by U.S. Undersecretary of State, John Holum, discussed with China Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of Chinese army, Xiong Guangkai and arms-control experts of the Chinese army about the possibility of China joining the Missile Technology Control Regime.  The meeting lasted for a day and half. </seg>
<seg id=4> The focus of discussion is how to conclude the indication made by Jiang Zeming, President of the People's Republic of China, this June when President Clinton visited China. </seg>
<seg id=5> At that time, Jiang Zeming indicated that China would consider joining the Missile Technology Control Regime.  The indication has been taken as the principle result of the meeting between the two State heads. </seg>
<seg id=6> A member of the U.S. delegation indicated to Associated Press that U.S. suspects China might still be exporting missile parts or missile technology.  Pakistan and Iran are the two beneficiaries for China's missile technology export. </seg>
<seg id=7> This official said that U.S. would continue to put the issue to China.  Nevertheless, he thought that China is also trying some measures to solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's export of missile technology causes frequent conflicts in Sino-US relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Since the two South Asia sub-continent countries, India and Pakistan, conducted nuclear tests one after the other in the first half of this year, U.S. sensed the importance to obtain an undertaking from China on the issue of transfer of missile technology.  Pakistan, one of the competing opponents in the South Asia sub-continent, is a long time alliance of China. </seg>
<seg id=10> As early as 1993, U.S. imposed an economic sanction on China because China sold missile parts and technology to Pakistan.  The sanction was lifted in 1994 after China stopped the export of surface-to-surface missiles. </seg>
<seg id=11> U.S. is worrying that missile trades between China and Iran might affect U.S. allies in Middle East and hence a major threat to U.S. interests. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the U.S. official disclosing the previously mentioned information did not wish to go into details as to when and as to what sort of missile technology that China had provided Pakistan and Iran. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said that there is not enough evidence at this point to prove China have indeed exported missile technology to the two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> In the past, whenever U.S. had evidence to show that China exported missile technology to these two countries, China usually denied it completely or otherwise suggested the technologies have more than one use and China was exporting them for peace usage. </seg>
<seg id=15> Up till now, China has not made any open response to comments by officials of the U.S. delegation. </seg>
<seg id=16> Furthermore, according to Associated Press in Beijing, Washington already determined that North Korea was helping Pakistan in missile development and the launch of Ghauri missile in April this year. </seg>
