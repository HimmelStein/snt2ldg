<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence France-Presse, Jakarta) An international press-freedom organization, "Committee to Protect Journalists", expressed alarm at the Indonesian police summons against a reporter over a story on the rape of Chinese women in May riot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Reporter Goenawan of "Jakarta-Jakarta" magazine has been told to appear at the Police headquarters for questions, the New York based Committee to Protect Journalists said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to the Committee, Goenawan published a story in July quoting the words of a Chinese woman who was raped. </seg>
<seg id=5> The "New York Times" also published a story on June 10 quoting the words of the same victim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In a letter to Indonesian President Habibie, the Committee said that by issuing a summons, "the police have taken the first step towards prosecution". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The Committee was "concerned that the use of such laws can have a negative impact on freedom of expression". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Committee was referring to pressure by a group of Indonesian Muslim organizations to the government.  These organizations demanded that Goenawan be arrested under article 156 of the criminal code. </seg>
<seg id=9> The code prohibits people from defaming a religious group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The International Alliance of Independent Journalists also protested against the police summons to Goenawan. </seg>
<seg id=11> This could set "a precedent that could set back the increased freedom enjoyed by the press since the fall of former President Suharto", the Alliance said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> The Committee to Protect Journalists urged Habibie to "stop disturbing Goenawan" and should ask all parities to settle their disputes in a civil court. </seg>
<seg id=13> The Committee also asked all parties in the society to "work vigorously towards the elimination of criminal defamation articles in Indonesian criminal code". </seg>
