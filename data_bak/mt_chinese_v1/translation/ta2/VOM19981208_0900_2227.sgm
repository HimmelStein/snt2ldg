<seg id=1> Cheng Huaren, person in charge at State Economic and Trade Commission indicated that the Chinese army and other government departments have to break off their control over subordinate enterprises in the near future. </seg>
<seg id=2> Notwithstanding that the Chinese Government has issued several similar orders before, it appears the determination this time is much stronger. </seg>
<seg id=3> Please listen to the report prepared by Voice of America correspondent Ning Xin. </seg>

<seg id=4> According to Cheng Huaren, person in charge at State Economic and Trade Commission, the Chinese army has to break off all relations with subordinate companies and enterprises before December 20. </seg>
<seg id=5> All other Party, Government and Judicial Departments must start similar actions at the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Jiang Zeming, President of China, ordered the army and the police to stop operating enterprises, hotels and other commercial facilities in July this year in order to control corruptions and smugglings that are getting worst everyday inside the army. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to Cheng Huaren, some enterprises under the control of the army in Shanghai and Tianjin have already been transferred to local governments.  However, he did not say whether the army received any compensation or not. </seg>
<seg id=8> The army is not alone in this.  Other Party, Government and Judicial Departments must rescind all control and management of subordinate state enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=9> China's state enterprises have more than 100 million employees.  Many of these state enterprises are actually on the verge of bankruptcy because of serious bad debts, "dead debts", and weakness in export markets due to global economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=10> According to Cheng Huaren, many state enterprises are currently employing ten times the number of employees that they actually needed.  This has intensified the loss situation in many state enterprises in the past one-year. </seg>
<seg id=11> The fact indicates it is an urgent task to improve the competitive position of state enterprises in the market. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, analysts thought that corruptions and poor management are common in Government Departments and Judicial Departments that are currently in charge of these state enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common situation is that many government officials are in charge of a certain industry but at the same time they are also in charge of the operations of enterprises in the same industry. </seg>
<seg id=14> These officials can then use authority of their offices and supply contracts, loans and preferential tax treatments to enterprises connected to them. </seg>
<seg id=15> This phenomenon destroyed fair competition in the market and obstructed China's migration from a planned economy to a market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> It is understood that the largest state enterprises, actually over 500 of them, formerly under control of Party, Government or Judicial Departments are to be supervised by a newly formed committee in the State Council.  The employees in these state enterprises will be looked after by the State Personnel Department. </seg>
<seg id=17> Local governments will manage smaller state enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=18> The Ministry of Finance will centralize the supervision and control of financial and investment companies. </seg>
<seg id=19> It is not clear at this point in time whether these changes will mean a reduction in loans from the state and hence, for these large state enterprises, a gradual moves towards bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=20> According to some analysts, China may resort to merger rather than bankruptcy to solve the problem of serious losses in state enterprises.  There are concerns that high unemployment may impact the stability of the society. </seg>
