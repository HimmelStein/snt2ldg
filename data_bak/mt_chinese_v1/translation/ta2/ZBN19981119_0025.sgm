<p>
<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur) Lien Hoe Berhad expects to be able to redeem the remaining 65% (Malaysian Ringgit 53.81 million) of the bond before the end of the year through loans to be obtained from banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The total issued amount of Lien Hoe Berhad 6% redeemable guaranteed bond was RM 85.74 million and the maturity date was August 17, 1998. </seg>
<seg id=4> Due to weakness in real estate markets and a contraction in hot money, Lien Hoe Berhad managed to redeem only 35% of the outstanding bond on maturity date.  The maturity date for the remaining 65% was extended to August 17, 2000 at an interest rate of 15%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Last month, the Securities Trading Commission approved the maturity date extension of Lien Hoe Berhad's bond to August 17, 2000.  This is the first time in Malaysia that a group of companies has successfully obtained a maturity date extension for its bonds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Given that interest rate is heading down in the markets, Lien Hoe Berhad plans to use bank loans to redeem the remaining bond and avoids paying a high interest rate of 15% to bond holders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> According to the Managing Director of Lien Hoe Berhad, the Company expects to reverse its inferior position recorded in first half of this year.  He cited the current trend of a lower interest rate and the new fiscal budget appears to benefit real estate development as reasons.  He expects the Company to achieve a satisfactory result in the second half of this year. </seg>
