<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur) The Vice Finance Minister of Malaysia Wang Shihua said that the foreign exchange measure will be expiring on September first after one year in effect.  It is predicted that more than 10,000,000 Malaysian dollars from foreign investors on the stock market might be lost.  So the government will do their best to maintain a good environment to encourage the foreign investors to stay in Malaysia. </seg>

<seg id=3> He said that Malaysia's economy has started to recover based on the economic growth reported in the third quarter.  He believes that by September of next year, the economy will stabilize and the market will be stronger, and then foreign investors will decide to participate in more investment projects in Malaysia. </seg>
