<p>
<seg id=2> (Manila) The day before yesterday, the Philippine Foreign Minister Shiashong said that, Cambodia has no hope to join the Asian Pacific Security Committee during the summit meeting that will be held in Hanoi next month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Shiashong said that, even if the Cambodian opposition groups could put together a combined government before the upcoming Summit meeting, it will not automatically become a member of the Asian Pacific Security Committee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that: " many members of this committee are still heel-dragging." </seg>
<seg id=5> At present, there are still too many questions, and Cambodia is still carrying through its political process. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accept them as a new member, afterwards, they might start to fight with each other again, then we will have to face this problem." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Malaysian Foreign Minister Arladu said that, whether Cambodia will be able to join the Asian Pacific Security Committee will be decided by if they can establish a legal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Shiashong said that,"someone once said, haven't we already learned this lesson before? That time we were just about to accept them, and found out that they had already started to fight with each other again only a few days later." </seg>
<seg id=9> What he referred to obviously was the incident that happened just before Cambodia reached the agreement with the Asian Pacific Security Committee in April 1997. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> At that time, Cambodia wanted to join, but failed to join because Han Shun used force to take over King Nanalee's government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Han Shun's Cambodian People's Party won the election in July this year, but this party couldn't gain a necessary two-thirds majority. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Han Shun and Nanalee reached an agreement to set up a combined government, however the new government has not yet truly become established. </seg>
