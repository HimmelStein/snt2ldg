<seg id=2> (APF-Jakarta) "Protecting News Reports Committee", an international organization for supporting press freedom, was shocked to learn that the writer, who reported the news that a Chinese woman was violated during the rebellion in May, was called for questioning by the police.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The office in New York, of the "Protecting News Reports Committee" said that, Gunawan, a reporter from "Jakarta - Jakarta" was called into the police headquarters for questioning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> This Committee said that, Gunawan quoted the conversation from the woman who was raped in his report published in the monthly magazine in July. </seg>
<seg id=5> "New York Times" also quoted this same victim's words in a report that was published on June 10. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In the letter to the Indonesian President, Habibi, this Committee wrote that, this subpoena is "the first step that the police took for proceeding further charges." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> This Committee " is very concerned that this kind of conduct will have a negative impact on free speech." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> What the Committee indicated here is that the Indonesian Muslim Organization put pressure on the government, and asked the government to arrest Gunawan by applying the number 156 regulation in the civil criminal code. </seg>
<seg id=9> This regulation forbids people to slander religious organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The International Independent Reporters Association also protested that the police took Gunawan for questioning. </seg>
<seg id=11> It said that, this will "set a precedent, and will weaken the freedom of the media press which has been improving since the former president Suhatu stepped down." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> " Protecting News Reports Committee" urged Habibi to "stop putting pressure on Gunawan", and asked all parties to solve the discord issue in a civil criminal court. </seg>
<seg id=13> It also appealed that everyone should "try their best to remove that slander regulation from the civil criminal code." </seg>
