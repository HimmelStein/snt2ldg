<seg id=1> The Chinese National Economic and Trade Committee Leader Huaren Cheng expressed that the Chinese military and law enforcement departments will no longer be in charge of subordinate enterprises in the near future. </seg>
<seg id=2> The Chinese government has delivered several similar statements in the past. However, the determination of this proceeding seems stronger than before. </seg>
<seg id=3> Please listen to the following report by Sheng Nin from the Voice of America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Chinese National Economic and Trade Committee Leader Huaren Cheng expressed that the Chinese Military will completely separate from their subordinate enterprises before December 20. </seg>
<seg id=5> The other law enforcement agencies and departments will also take part in similar proceedings from the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> The Chairman of China Jiang Zemin ordered in July of this year that the Military and Provincial Law Enforcement Agencies are to stop operating their subordinate enterprises such as restaurants and other commercial facilities in order to control the increasingly widespread corruption and smuggling situation inside the Military. </seg>
<seg id=7> Huaren Cheng expressed that up till now some military subordinate enterprises in Shanghai and TianJin have already been turned over to the local governments.  However, he didn't say if the military is going is going to get any compensations or not. </seg>
<seg id=8> Except the fact that the military must hand over control of their subordinate enterprises, the other Law Enforcement agencies will also no longer operate their subordinate enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=9> China has more than 100,000,000 workers in the State-owned enterprises.  Due to the problems of serious bad accounting and dead end accounting, and the weak export market caused by the Global Economic crisis, many State-owned enterprises actually are on the edge of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=10> Huaren Cheng said that the current employee numbers in many state-owned enterprises are ten times more than are actually needed, which causes serious losses of money from those enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=11> This indicated that accelerating the marketing competitiveness of the State-owned enterprises has become urgent. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, the analysts expressed that the government agencies and law enforcement agencies in charge of State-owned enterprises are commonly full of corruption and bad management. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common situation is that many government officials who are in charge of an industry, are also in charge of operating similar enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=14> As a result they may use their authority to provide these enterprises with contracts, loans, and favorable taxes. </seg>
<seg id=15> This situation damages the fair competition in the market, and further becomes an obstacle for changing China's economy from a planned economy to a free market. </seg>
<seg id=16> It was introduced that more than 500 large state-owned industries that are originally subordinate enterprises of the law enforcement departments will be supervised by a new committee set up by the State Counsel. The employees of those enterprises will be arranged by the Department of Human Resources. </seg>
<seg id=17> The smaller enterprises will be taken over by the local governments. </seg>
<seg id=18> In addition, the finance and investment companies will be under unified management under the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> Currently it is not yet clear whether these changes mean that the government will reduce the loans given to state-owned enterprises. Which could result in lots of large enterprises going bankrupt. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts think that the government worried about larg scale unemployment may cause turbulence in the society, so the government may be more likely to combine some of the large companies rather than allow them to become bankrupt. </seg>
