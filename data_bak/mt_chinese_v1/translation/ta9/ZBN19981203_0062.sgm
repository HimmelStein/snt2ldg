<seg id=2> (AFP Sydney) A survey that came out yesterday shows that, thousands of British immigrants left Australia, because they feel that local Australian people dislike and discriminates against British people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The British Immigrants Association urged the government to face this problem for the sake of local immigrants and the Australian economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Chairman of this Association, Hunter pointed out that British Immigrants feel that Australian local people dislike and discriminate against British people. Bcause of this, it is likely that Australia is losing more than 100,000 dollars every year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said that so many British people left Australia is very disappointing to see.  Because most of those people are financially independent and technically skilled workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told the reporters that "according to the immigration regulations those immigrants are not the people that you want to keep out." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The British account for 14% of Australia's population. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, statistics from the Immigration Department shows that during 1996-1997 there were 11,978 British who Immigrated to Australia, and in the same time there were 3,737 British who left Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Hunter said that the Association conducted the survey in Brisbane and found that one quarter of the British people believe that the local Australians discriminate against them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Almost 40% of those who were interviewed felt that the local people like the non-British people better. </seg>
<seg id=11> 37% of the British people surveyed pointed out that their complaints are not treated as seriously as those of other immigrants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> About 35 of those surveyed blamed the media for fueling the anti-British feelings in the local people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Hunter said that the former Prime Minister Keating also played a bad role in this with his anti-British views. </seg>
