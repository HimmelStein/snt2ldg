<p>
<seg id=2> The day before yesterday, Portugal's Attorney General's Office said that, the attorney General's office is working on a Portuguese councilors proposal, requesting to extradite the former Indonesian president Suharto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The councilor, Keleiya Xierwa said in a letter that, Suharto should be extradited to face his charges of human rights abuses. </seg>
<seg id=4> Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony, East Timor in 1975, and merged it into the Indonesian territories several weeks later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The spokeswoman from Portugal's Attorney General's Office, Sarah Pina, said that, " we are studying to see if we can do this under Portuguese law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The Human Rights Organization recalled the Indonesian military's misconduct of human right in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Xierwa said that, recently the former Chilean dictator, Pinochet, was extradited to Spain to face his charges of being a racial genocidal butcher, and this increased the determination to obtain the extradition of Suharto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> At present, Pinochet is in London, waiting for the decision from the Upper Court to see if he will be extradited. </seg>
<seg id=9> The British High Court repealed the initial charge, and the reason was that Pinochet, as a former leader of a country, has immunity from being extradited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Xierwa is a member of Portugal's Right Wing Party. </seg>
<seg id=11> He said that, the UN still considers Portugal to be the legal administer of East Timor, and this helps when they request the extradition of Suharto. </seg>
