<seg id=1> Arriving at Beijing to hold talks on the possibility of China participating as soon as possible in controlling missile technology, a US delegation from the State Department of Security thinks that, China may still be continuing to export it's missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Please listen to the following colligate report, by Yuan Fang, from Voice of America. </seg>

<seg id=3> The American officials, lead by the vice Minister of the US State Council Holeman, met Tang Jiaqi, the Chinese Minister of Foreign affairs, in Beijing. The vice chief of staff from China's military, Xiong Guangkai, and some other Chinese military specialists held a one and half day meeting to discuss the matter of China's possible participation in controlling the export of missile technologies. </seg>
<seg id=4> The meeting mainly focused on how to accomplish the stated objectives that were expressed by Jiang Zemin, the Chairman of China, when President Clinton was paying an official visit to China in June of this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> Then and there, Jiang Zemin advised that, China will take the idea of participating in controlling missile technologies into consideration, which has been considered one of the major achievements resulting from the US and China's summit meeting. </seg>
<seg id=6> An American representative said to the Associated Press that, the US still has some suspicions about whether China is still exporting its missile technologies to other countries, and that Pakistan and Iraq are two of the countries that have benefited from China's exported missile technology. </seg>
<seg id=7> This official said that, the US has been continuing to pursue this question. He believes that China is also taking some steps to solve these problems. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's export of missile technology has been a regular grinding problem in the relationship between the US and China. </seg>
<seg id=9> Since the first half of this year, India and Pakistan, two opposing countries in the Southern Asian subcontinent, began to carry out a series of nuclear tests one after another. The US feels that it is becoming increasingly necessary for China to make good on its promise to control sales of missile technologies.  One of the nuclear contestants in the southern Asian subcontinent, Pakistan is China's long time ally. </seg>
<seg id=10> As early as 1993, due to China's selling missile parts and technologies to Pakistan, the US implemented economic restrictions towards China until the US decided to withdraw the restriction in 1994, after China promised to stop exporting tactical ground based missiles. </seg>
<seg id=11> The US is also concerned that, the missile exchanges between China and Iraq may constitute a serious threat to the interests of the US and its allied nations in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the US official who revealed the above information, declined to provide further details about when and what kinds of missile technologies China provided to Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said that, at present, there is not enough evidence to prove that China has positively exported missile technologies to these two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> In the past, whenever the US found evidence that China was exporting missile technologies to these two countries, China always either denied the sales, or claimed they were commercial and military technologies only.  The purpose of these exports was only to achieve the peace. </seg>
<seg id=15> Until now, China has not publicly responded to the US Delegation Representative's words. </seg>
<seg id=16> Additionally, according to the Associated Press Reports from Beijing, Washington has already proved that in April of this year, the country that helped Pakistan launch a Gaoli missile was North Korea and not China. </seg>
