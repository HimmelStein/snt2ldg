<seg id=2> Xinhua News agency, New York, March 6th, by Xisheng Zhou-American Ambassador to China, James Sasser made a speech at the lunch meeting held by the national American-Chinese relationship committee in New York on March 6th. He called on the US "to adopt a lasting and reliable constructive foreign policy towards China with a strategic vision", and solve the differences between China and the US on some issues by frank and comprehensive dialogs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> James Sasser pointed out that, the US should properly recognize the fact that China has been rising on the international stage, and the US should regard the development of a steady and healthy relationship with China as a great opportunity for US foreign policies at the end of this century as well as in the next century. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> When talking about Human Rights and Intellectual Property Rights protection in China, this ambassador pointed out that, China has been making great progress in these two areas. </seg>
<seg id=5> He considers that the freedoms and democracy that Chinese people are experiencing now can not be compared to the China of the past, and China has taken a positive and co-operational attitude on the issue of Intellectual Property Rights protection, which the US should not overlook. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> James Sasser also suggested that, after China joins the World Trade Association, the US Congress should call off the annual discussions on whether China should be regarded as having most favored nation trading status, and should offer China most favored nation trading status permanently. </seg>
<seg id=7> He pointed out that, actually, it isn't beneficial to the US to have the annual discussion about the Chinese status in Congress, which negatively affects confidence towards China by American merchants, and further affects American employment opportunities. </seg>
