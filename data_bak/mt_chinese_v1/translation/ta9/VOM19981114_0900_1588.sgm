<seg id=1> It is well known that the El Nino phenomenon caused many serious results, including the long lasting fires in Indonesia, flooding in Desert areas of Peru, and many other unusual climate changes in regions all over the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> Earlier this year there was flooding in California and all the Southern States in the US.  Then many areas in the Southern States suffered severe droughts. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to the specialists, the current El Nino is turning into a new weather phenomenon called El Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> El Nina may have even more frightening affects on the climate than El Nino. Please listen to the following as reported by Nan Li sent by the Voice of America from Chicago as announced by Zhifong Qi. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> It's always very cold in the winter in Chicago. However, last years winter was much warmer than usual, and the amount of snowfall dropped dramatically.   Next winter is also predicted to be similar. </seg>
<seg id=6> At the same time, El Nino hit the area of South East Asia, causing huge amounts of rain to fall in some places, while other areas remained so dry that it caused uncontrollable wild fires for weeks. </seg>
<seg id=7> The El Nino and El Nina are both the result of climate changes that have caused unusual warming of the Ocean waters near the tropical areas of the Eastern Pacific. </seg>
<seg id=8> El Nino indicates that the temperature of the surface water is much higher than usual causing the air above it to also warm and changing the climate of different regions in the world. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nina indicates that the temperature of the surface water near the tropical Pacific is much lower than usual, its influence on regional climates is just the opposite of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Meteorologist Luff from the US National Climatic Data Center said that the fires in Indonesia may not be uncontrollable in the next year, because it has been predicted that there will be more rain than usual between December of this year and March of next year. </seg>
<seg id=11> Meanwhile, the temperatures in West and South East Africa will be a little lower than usual.  There will be more rain in the Northern part of South American. </seg>
<seg id=12> The weather will be much drier than usual in the southern part of the US, which means that droughts in Texas and New Mexico may continue. </seg>
<seg id=13> However, the opportunities for forest fires in Florida may increase. </seg>
<seg id=14> The huge amount of rainfall in California and the Southern part of the US this year are both caused by El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Luff said that El Nino is not able to produce rainfalls, but it provides the conditions to have strong and heavy winds. </seg>
<seg id=16> This summer is one of the hottest summers in US records. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some people connect global warming with this El Nino phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id=18> Luff thinks this connection may be possible, however, there is no proof at present. </seg>
<seg id=19> are other reasons or not, The Northern and Middle Western parts of the US will have to face a colder winter and more snow this year. </seg>
