<seg id=4> With the approach of nightfall, the army fired shots to disperse groups of young people who were throwing rocks at the soldiers. </seg>
<seg id=5> A few hours ago, several thousand people started fires to burn a bank that is less than one kilometer away from the Presidents Residence.  The flames spread rapidly to the nearby stores. </seg>
<seg id=6> These young people used traffic posts to break in the doors of shops. </seg>
<seg id=7> When the rioters began attacking Chinese on Saturday, one group grabbed a Chinese man in the street and beat him and then threw him in a creek. </seg>
<seg id=8> Later the military drove a military vehicle to rescue this badly wounded man. </seg>
<seg id=9> Tanks were called out to face the angry mobs who threw stones and broken glass at them and at the thousands of soldiers armed with guns and tear gas that were patrolling the streets to protect the commercial areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id=10> In that area, the businessmen who sold electronic products had to move to other locations after the violence in May. </seg>
<seg id=11> The reporter saw a 29-year-old young man named Ming wearing nothing but shorts and a belt standing behind a rope line. </seg>
<seg id=12> This young man is an employee of a computer company.  He said that he and all his neighbors who are Muslim had to stay up all night in order to protect their houses from the rioters trying to break in and rob them. </seg>
<seg id=13> Mr. Ming said that all the ropes were set up by all the neighbors after the violence in May, however they didn't expect that they would have to be used so soon after that. </seg>
<seg id=14> In some areas that already have the ropes set up, the residents used big wooden clubs to drive away groups of strangers. </seg>
<seg id=15> Another resident named Dashiyuta wearing a Muslim turban and robes. </seg>
<seg id=16> He told the reporter that those young people intending on looting most likely came over here from outside of China Town after they heard that there had been rioting here. </seg>
<seg id=17> The looters damaged a railway station that is only a kilometer away.  When the military chased and caught up with them they threw away stolen shoes and computers and clothes and shelves they had been carrying all over the street. </seg>
