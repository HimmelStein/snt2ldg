<seg id=5> The US Democratic Congressmen Letterman and Kelly made an announcement in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. They urged the Clinton government to approve the agreement that was signed in Tokyo this week. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two Congressmen both indicated that, this will enhance the US representatives' position, and this will make it possible for the developing countries to also make commitments on the issue of reducing the amount of damage caused by the green-house effect. </seg>
<seg id=7> Actually this is an essential term in several bills that were proposed by the Senate in the past. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some US Senators in Buenos Aires said that they are against the Clinton government's approving any kind of actions. </seg>
<seg id=9> The Chairman of the US Science Committee, a Republican Senator from Wisconsin, Shenshenbulunna said that, the Tokyo agreement has fatal shortcomings, and will definitely be voted down by the US Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said that, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Senator Shenshenbulunna said that, this agreement had already reached a dead end by the time it was sent to the Senate, as it has currently been set aside. The US Senate will not pass this bill. </seg>
<seg id=12> The question is what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> Either attempt to save it, or announcing that it has fatal shortcomings and restarting further discussions. </seg>
<seg id=14> Senator Shenshenbulunna said that, this is not an argument between two parties in the US House of Representatives and the Senate, several famous Democratic Senators have also agreed. </seg>
<seg id=15> Democratic Senators from Pennsylvania, Clinka said that, he is against this agreement because it will reduce the employment opportunities and lower the level of American industrialization. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Democratic Senators from Ohio Kuqichi does not agree with Shenshenbulunna's idea. He compares the fight against the global warming phenomena with the striving for a world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said that the same kind of determination will lead the Tokyo agreement to success. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said that, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> Senator Kuqichi said that, I hope this process will be continuing. Whether the US Congress is involved or not, we should not ignore the inevitability of needing a global resolution to the approaching problem, because of one Congressman adhering stubbornly to his own opinion. </seg>
<seg id=20> Inside the main conference room in Buenos Aires, the representatives are discussing all kinds of questions. Some of those questions will have to wait to be solved at Wednesday's meeting by the 160 Resources and Environment Ministers who are representing their countries by attending this conference. </seg>
<seg id=21> The US representatives said that, some questions that concern the US Congress may have to be postponed until next year's conference. However, this conference has made some progress. </seg>
