<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, August 31st. The "Jerusalem Post" today quoted Savil, the Director of Foreign Ministry Bureau of Israel who is currently visiting the US, as saying that the World Bank had decided to provide the autonomous leading organizations of Palestine with $250 million of aid before the end of 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This decision broke the impasse between the countries providing aid and the autonomous leading organizations, which had lasted for almost one year. </seg>
<seg id=4> In the international conference concerning the aid to Palestine autonomy, which was held in Washington on October 1st of last year, the countries providing aid assured in the following five years they would provide $2.4 billion for the development, $750 million of which would be assigned in the first year. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, the aid countries alleged that they would refuse to fulfill the promise completely as there was not enough necessary mechanism and accounting items dealing with the aiding money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Savil said, America and the World Bank agreed to pay part of the fund as soon as possible though they were still not satisfied with the accounting work of Palestine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Executive Chairman of Palestinian Liberation Organization, Yasar Arafat, and other leaders are often critical of aiding countries not fulfilling their promise to provide funds in a timely fashion. </seg>
<seg id=8> It has been predicted that the two chief representatives for negotiation, Saaa from the PLO, and Rothschild from Israel will go to Washington and discuss with America and the World Bank details regarding the implementation of the funds. </seg>
