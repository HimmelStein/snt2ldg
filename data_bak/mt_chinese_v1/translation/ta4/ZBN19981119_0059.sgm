</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AP, Lisbon) Portugal Attorney General's office stated on the day before yesterday, that they were evaluating the demands of extraditing Suharto, the ex-president of Indonesia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Councilor Corea Silva said in one letter that Suharto should be extradited for his violation of human rights in East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=4> Indonesia invaded East Timor, the former Portuguese colony, in 1975 and annexed it into Indonesia several weeks later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sara Pina, spokeswoman of the Press Officer of the Attorney General said, "we are studying whether it can be done according to Portugal's laws." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Human rights organizations rebut the activities of the Indonesian army violating human rights in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Silva said that the fact that Pinochet, the ex-autocrat of Chile, might be extradited to Spain on charges of genocide, strengthens his determination to extradite Suharto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Currently Pinochet is in London, waiting for the Upper House to make a decision on whether to extradite him. </seg>
<seg id=9> The UK High Court of Justice negated the original arrest warrant for Pinochet, because he was a former national leader and entitled to immunity against lawsuits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Silva is a member of the Public Party, a right wing party in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id=11> He said that the UN still regards Portugal as the legal supervisory nation of East Timor, which may help them to press their demand for extradition of Suharto. </seg>
