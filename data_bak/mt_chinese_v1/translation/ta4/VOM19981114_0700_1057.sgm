<seg id=1> An American arms control delegation coming to Beijing to discuss China entering an agreement on control of guided missile technology believes China may be continuing to export missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Here is the report from VOA correspondent Fang Yuan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A group of American officials led by the US State Department Deputy Secretary of State Holmes, held a one-and-a-half day talk with Tang Jiaxuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Xiong Guangkai, Deputy of Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, along with experts on arms control, to discuss China's entry into an agreement on control of guided missile technology. </seg>
<seg id=4> The talks mainly focused on how to implement declarations made by President Jiang Zemin during President Clinton's visit to China in June. </seg>
<seg id=5> At that time, Jiang Zemin said China would consider entering the agreement on missile control, seen as one of the main achievements of the Sino-American summit. </seg>
<seg id=6> A member of the delegation said to Associated Press that America is still in doubt as to whether China is exporting missile parts or missile technology, Pakistan and Iran being two beneficiaries of such. </seg>
<seg id=7> The official said America will continue to raise the issue with China, and he believes China is adopting measures to deal with this problem. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's export of missile technology has often caused friction in Sino-American relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Ever since the two old enemies of the South Asian continent, India and Pakistan, began nuclear testing in the first half of this year, America has felt it necessary for China in particular to consent to the agreement on the control of guided missile technology, as India's adversary Pakistan has been a long term ally of China. </seg>
<seg id=10> As early as 1993, America has enacted economic sanctions against China because China sold missile parts and technology to Pakistan, which lasted till 1994 when China guaranteed it would stop exporting land-to-land missiles. </seg>
<seg id=11> America also worries that the missile trade between China and Iran will form a severe challenge to the interests of its partners in the middle-east as well as America itself. </seg>
<seg id=12> But the American official giving the above information declined to discuss further the type of missile technology involved, or when China offered it to Pakistan and Iran. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said there was not enough evidence to prove that China exported missile technology to the two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> When America has obtained evidence proving China exported missile technology, China usually denies it or says that the technology has multiple uses, and that it will only be used for non-military ends. </seg>
<seg id=15> To date, China has not made any comments on the talks with American officials. </seg>
<seg id=16> In addition, AP reported from Beijing that Washington has proved it was not China but North Korea who helped Pakistan in researching the making of the Gaoli-type missile this April. </seg>
