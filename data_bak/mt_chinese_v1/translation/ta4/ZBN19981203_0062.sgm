<seg id=1> Claiming Discrimination by Local Residents, Thousands of UK Immigrants Leave Australia </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP, Sydney) According to statistics of a poll taken yesterday, under the accusation of "hostility towards UK people" and discrimination from local residents, thousands of immigrants from the UK have decided to leave Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> To the benefit of immigrants and Australia, the UK Immigrants Association appealed to the government to face the problem squarely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The President of the Association,Handt, pointed out that UK people thought Australians were "hostile towards UK people", and it has likely caused the Australian economy to "lose up to millions of dollars annually." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said it was very disappointing that so many British people had chosen to leave Australia, because almost all of those departing were financially independent, skillful workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told the reporters, "according to the local immigration regulations, these immigrants don't belong to a category you want to just throw away." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> UK people account for 14% of Australian immigrants. </seg>
<seg id=8> According to statistics from the Immigration Office, although 11,978 new UK immigrants came to Australia between 1996 and 1997, 3,737 persons left during the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Handt said it was discovered that one quarter of the British people felt discriminated against in Australia since an investigation undertaken in Melbourne by the association itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 40% of those interviewed think local residents favor non-UK people. </seg>
<seg id=11> 37% pointed out complaints of UK immigrants that they will not be treated as equally as other races. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> About 35% of those interviewed blame the media as the chief reason that local residents hold preconceptions of UK immigrants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Handt said the hostile stance of Keating, the former Prime Minister of Australia, did nothing to help the matter either. </seg>
