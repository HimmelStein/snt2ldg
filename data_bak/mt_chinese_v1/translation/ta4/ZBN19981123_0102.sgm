<seg id=2> (AFP, Manila) The Philippines Foreign Minister Acison stated 2 days ago that Cambodia was had no hope of joining ASEAN, during the summit meeting of ASEAN leaders held in Hannoi next month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Acison said that even hostile parties of Cambodia set up a unite government before the summit meeting, it can still not become a member of ASEAN automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said," many ASEAN members are still hesitant. </seg>
<seg id=5> Currently, many problems still exist and the political process in Cambodia is still on-going. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accept them as new members now, and they fight again later, we'll have to resolve the problem once more." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Adola, Malaysia Foreign Minister, said that whether Cambodia can join ASEAN depends upon whether or not it can set up a legal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Acison said," someone said, haven't we been deceived once before? At that time we were preparing to accepting them, but they fought again only several days later." </seg>
<seg id=9> нъ Apparently he referred to Cambodia near-successful bid to join ASEAN in April,1997. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> At that time the reason why Cambodia could not join ASEAN was that Hung Sen overthrew Prince Ranaried by force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> The People's Party of Cambodia,led by Hung Sen, won the election this past July, but the party didn't achieve more than two thirds seats to come into power by itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week Hung Sen had reached agreements with Ranaried to set up a joint government, but the new government had not formally come into being. </seg>
