<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 23rd, Reporter: Liu Yaming. Recently, relevant experts discovered a large quantity of dinosaur fossils in the town of Yangcheng, which lies in Henan Province's Xixia County. </seg>
<seg id=3> This is another important discovery to be made in this area.  Last year, an abundance of dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in the same area. </seg>

<seg id=4> The reporter knew from Henna Cultural Archaeology Research Institute that noted experts found several hundred dinosaur skeletons in Yangcheng this past April.  The fossils were found between river sedimentary layers at places such as Tiger Head Hill.  Among the finds were numerous bones, including ribs and toe bones. </seg>
<seg id=5> Because of the long-term exposure at ground level, some of the fossils have already broken apart. </seg>
<seg id=6> Judging from the geologic strata, all fossils date from the cretaceous period. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> According to the judgment of the experts, a large quantity of dinosaur skeletons and the fossils of other species remain buried in the area where these dinosaur fossils have been discovered. </seg>

<seg id=9> The discovery is very important to the classification of the dinosaurs from the Xixia, and sheds light onto their zoological habit and reproduction behavior, to restore the original environment in dinosaur ages, to reveal the rules of crust change and environmental evolution on Earth. </seg>
<seg id=10> The discovery of these dinosaur fossils also provides an important clue to aid in further fossil excavations and burying order in the region. </seg>
