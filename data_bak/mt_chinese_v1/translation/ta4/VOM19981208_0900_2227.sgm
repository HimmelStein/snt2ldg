<seg id=1> Sheng Huaren, head of China's National Economic and Trade Committee, said the army and some other governmental departments would relinquish all control of affiliated enterprises in the near future. </seg>
<seg id=2> Though the Chinese government has made such statements several times, this time the decision seems likely to go ahead. </seg>
<seg id=3> Now a report from VOA correspondent Ning Xin. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Sheng Huaren, head of China's National Economic and Trade Committee, said China's military will renounce all control of affiliated enterprises before December 20th. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other party and government departments as well as judicial departments must take similar action from the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered this July that the army and military police should stop running enterprises, hotels and other commercial institutions in order to control the spread of corruption and smuggling in the army. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren said that to date the control of some army-affiliated enterprises in Shanghai and Tianjin has been transferred to the control of local governments, but did not mention whether the army would receive compensation. </seg>
<seg id=8> In addition to the army's release of control of affiliated enterprises, other party, governmental and judicial departments would no longer run affiliated enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=9> There are more than one hundred million workers in state-run enterprises in China, and many such enterprises are in fact on the edge of bankruptcy due to heavy debts and a weak export market brought about by the global economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said the number of the working staff in many state-run enterprises is ten times more than that actual needed, which last year increased the losses of enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=11> This indicates that the strengthening of the market competitiveness of state run enterprises is very urgent. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, analysts said that poor management and corruption was a common occurrence in the government and judicial departments which run state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=13> It is common to see government officials in charge of certain industries at the same time running enterprises in those same industries. </seg>
<seg id=14> Therefore they can abuse their power to provide them with preferential treatment in regard to contracts, loans and taxes. </seg>
<seg id=15> Such actions destroy fair competition in the marketplace, which hinders transformation from a planned economy to a free market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> It is understood that a committee recently established by the State Council will inspect more than 500 of the largest state-run enterprises previously affiliated to the governmental and judicial departments, and the Ministry of Personnel will select the workers in these enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=17> Local governments will manage the smaller enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=18> In addition, the Ministry of Finance will also control finance and investment corporations. </seg>
<seg id=19> It's not yet clear whether the changes mean the state will reduce its loans to the state-run enterprises and lead some big enterprises to become gradually bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts think China is likely to settle the problem of state-run enterprise debts through mergers, rather than bankruptcy, following concerns of the social turmoil caused by a high unemployment rate. </seg>
