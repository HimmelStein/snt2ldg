</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP Bangkok) The Communication Ministry of Thailand announced yesterday that Thailand would claim the Hopewell Group, a listed company in Hong Kong which took on the construction project of the Bangkok Viaduct Railway and Road System, should compensate US$6.8 billion (about S$11 billion) due to their failure in punctual completion of their end of the agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Paladi, Vice Communication Minister of Thailand, said that the Communication Ministry of Thailand and the National Railway Bureau were entitled to claim US$6.8 billion in losses due to the delay. Thailand condemned the Hopewell Group for completing only 12% of the former plan over the past 8 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Hopewell Group negotiated with the authorities of Thailand and gained no results in the financial dispute triggered by Thailand's currency problems following the Thai economic crisis and subsequent development dispute crisis. Thailand's government had terminated the agreement with Hopewell Group this January. </seg>
<seg id=5> Therefore, the Hopewell Group claimed that Thailand's government should refund the company 100 billion Thai Baht (about S$4.2 billion), to compensate them for funds invested and the partial project completion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Thailand's government said yesterday that Thailand was considering resuming this project involving US$3.2 billion, but reducing the project's scale. </seg>
<seg id=7> The Hopewell Group would never be permitted to take part in the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Paladi said the German government and KFW Bank were interested in resuming the huge project, and had decided to provide 100 million Thai Baht in funding to make feasibility studies of the Bangkok Viaduct and Road System Construction Project. </seg>

<seg id=9> Siemens Germany is currently cooperating with a local Thai company, and constructing another 23km long electric railway project in Bangkok. </seg>
