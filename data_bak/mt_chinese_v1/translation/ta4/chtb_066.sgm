</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 21st. City infrastructure construction, long seen as an obstacle to attracting foreign capital, has become the new field for Qinghai Province to make central use of foreign investment, second only to resource development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> City infrastructure construction investment in Xining had long been insufficient. The total investment during the 46 years from the establishment of new China to 1995 was only RMB 400 million.  The lack of investment restricted development of the city's economy. </seg>
<seg id=4> In the last two years, however, a number of foreign investors have expressed interest in construction projects in Xining. </seg>
<seg id=5> The government of Qinghai Province put forward the idea of commercialization of city infrastructure, and approved "Some Regulations on Encouraging and Attracting Foreign Investment in Xining City" early this year. </seg>

<seg id=6> Publication of the sale of rights to manage the east outward roadway of Xining City quickly led to the arrival of more than 10 foreign investors coming to the city to discuss the project.  The contract was finalized at a price of RMB 50 million. </seg>
<seg id=7> The project to modernize the Mojiajie old city as per designs catering to modern urban functions has been solely undertaken with an investment of RMB50 million from a Hongkong firm. </seg>
<seg id=8> The 6th water source project is utilizing an investment of RMB 20 million.  This project will allow the water supply capacity to reach 150 thousand tons per day, greatly improving the strained water supply condition of Xining city. </seg>
<seg id=9> For the north outward roadway project, a construction agreement that involves investment of about RMB 180 million has been reached with Hongkong Taihwa Company. The south ring road of the city freeway project has also attracted several foreign investors. </seg>
