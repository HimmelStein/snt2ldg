</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Suzuki, the vice cabinet secretary of Keizo Obuchi's government, told NHK TV that he believed the Prime Minister wants the 79-year-old Miyazawa to stay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Suzuki said," I think (Obuchi) privately hopes he can stay to promote the economic renewal plan." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Obuchi will meet with Miyazawa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> He said, "considering the scope of his ability, it is hard to find a person to replace him. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=16> The open comment of Keizo on the resign of Miyazawa is due to the fact that he had read related reports, and he plans to talk with the Finance Minister. </seg>
