<seg id=1> Next, let's first take a look at Canada. </seg>
<seg id=2> The International Trade Minister of Canada, Mr. Mackey, said that when exporting products, Canada should also export its values in order to promote the improvement of human rights in China and other Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id=3> Mackey made the comments in response to the suggestion by the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Canadian parliament that trade should be linked to human rights. </seg>
<seg id=4> VOA correspondent Yan Ming filed his report from Toronto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Canadian International Trade Minister Mackey actively responded to the suggestion by the Canadian parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission report that trade should be linked with human rights. </seg>
<seg id=6> Mackey said, Canada should take human rights as a new factor in Canada's foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=7> Ottawa Citizen reported that Canadian International Trade Minister Mackey made the comments on Thursday when attending a conference on diplomacy and international trade. </seg>
<seg id=8> Mackey said from what he saw at the APEC leaders' conference in Malaysia and the recent arrest of dissidents by the Chinese authorities persuaded him that no matter whether it was provision of economic aid or international trade, Canda should be exporting its values alongside its products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Human rights and social justice should become an important part of Canada's foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Canadian News Agency reported that the foreign affairs committee of Canada's upper house of parliament suggested that the government should review all aid projects, and make efforts to promote the improvement of human rights of local people alongside aiding countries' economic development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> The National Post reported that the Canadian parliament's foreign affairs committee report was just one sign that Canada's government was trying to adjust its policy to Asian countries including China. </seg>
<seg id=12> Canadian foreign minister Maxworth said on Thursday that Canada was very concerned about the arrest of Chinese dissidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said, we must respond to this incident. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have pointed out to the Chinese government that this contravenes the UN Convention of Civil and Political Rights signed by China. </seg>
<seg id=15> The Canadian News Agency reported that Canadian Premier Jean Cretien, during his visit to China last month, publicly criticed China's human rights record on several occasions, after over two years of silence on the matter. </seg>
<seg id=16> This unusual act by a Canadian premier implies some real changes in Canada's foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> The National Post reported that Canadian businessmen had different reactions to international trade minister Mackey's attitude supporting the connection of trade and human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> Someone privately worry it will affect the business of Canadian enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=19> While Dr. Zhu Yuzhao from University of Okanagan in British Columbia, Canada, holds a different opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> As regards North American capital, one of the main reasons for transferring investment, building factories, and trade to East Asia is of course to make money, to make a profit. </seg>
<seg id=21> But when entering East Asian countries they can also bring standards, for example labor protection, standards of welfare for labor, and environmental requirements, these standards can be brought to these countries, and it's bi-lateral. </seg>
<seg id=22> And this kind of standardization, has a direct impact on the improvement of human rights and labor rights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=23> That was VOA correspondent Yan Ming's report from Toronto. </seg>
