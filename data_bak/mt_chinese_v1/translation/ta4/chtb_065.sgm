<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st (Reporter: Wu Yu, Batman: Pu Hai). According to statistics from Shanghai Pudong Customs, imports and exports into and from the Pudong New Development Area (Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone included) for the months up to November this year totaled US$8.579 billion, an increase of almost 25% compared with the same period of last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> Total amount of imports and exports for the whole year is expected to exceed US$9 billion . </seg>

<seg id=4> Pudong's foreign trade during this year has been characterized by equilibrium between imports and exports and powerful growth. </seg>
<seg id=5> Trade of processed products developed quickly, with more than two hundred state-owned enterprises in the zone having now started trading in processed commodities.  These state-owned enterprises are basically equal to foreign enterprises in terms of numbers and recorded contractual amounts.  Moreover, the focus of manufacture and management methods is gradually turning from simple processing of raw materials to production of hi-tech and value added products. </seg>

<seg id=6> According to sources, the amount of imports and exports this year of foreign enterprises in Pudong increased to US$3.86 billion, up 37.4% compared with the same period last year.  This $3.86 billion represents 45% of the total value of imports and exports of Pudong.  This sharp increase in trade by foreign enterprises is believed to be due in part to foreign invested enterprises increasing imports of equipment that falls under investment.  Another reason for the increase is because in Pudong, China for the first time allowed foreign investment in foreign trade enterprises, establishing three foreign joint ventures engaging in trade. </seg>
