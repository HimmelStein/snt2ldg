<seg id=4> On the center of the stone is a very clear map of the People's Republic of China. </seg>
<seg id=5> The picture's two ends stand high with the middle downwards.  Its lower right area juts outwards, much like a crowing rooster with a bulging belly.  "Straits" separate the sides of the rooster's "belly".  On one side is the long Taiwan Island, and the round Hainan Island is on another side. </seg>

On the bottom of that, there is a golden facula like a traditional gold money "yuanbao".
