<seg id=1> Meteorologically we can see the results caused last year by the el nino phenomenon, including the continuous fire in Indonesia, the flood in the desert zones in Peru as well as world-wide serious regional climate abnormalities. </seg>
<seg id=2> At the beginning of This year flood ravaged California and the southern states of America, and after that drought occurred in the south. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to the experts, el nino is turning into a new phenomenon named la nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> What's more, next year la nina will be just as bad as el nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Here is a report sent by VOA correspondent Li Lan from Chicago, Qi Zhifeng reporting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Last year the freezing winter in Chicago was much warmer than in previous years, snow fall was also much less, it's predicted the next winter will be much the same. </seg>
<seg id=7> Meantime el nino was still tormenting North-east Asia, the amount of rainfall was seriously reduced, and drought caused wild file to rage for several weeks out of control. </seg>
<seg id=8> Both el nino and la nina were caused by the severe change of the water temperature on the surface of east pacific tropics. </seg>
<seg id=9> El nino was a result of the water temperature on the surface being much higher than normal, which affects airflow and changes the climates around the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La nina means the water temperature on the surface of tropic east pacific is much lower than normal, it's effect on many regional climates is just the opposite of that of el nino. </seg>
<seg id=11> An expert from the US National Meteorological Bureau, Raf, said the fire in Indonesia will probably not be out of control next year, since it's predicted that there will be more rainfall from this December to next March in this area compared with previous years. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time the temperature in West Africa and South-east Africa will be a bit lower than usual, and the rainfall in the north of South Africa will also be adequate. </seg>
<seg id=13> It will be drier in the south of America, which means there will be continuous drought in Texas and New Mexico, while in Florida there will be an increased chance of forest fires. </seg>
<seg id=14> The rain pour in California and southern areas this year were all caused by el nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Raf said, el nino cannot bring about storm, but will provide conditions for the formation of severe storms. </seg>
<seg id=16> This summer in America is the hottest in history. </seg>
<seg id=17> Someone connected global warming to the phenomenon of el nino. </seg>
<seg id=18> Raf thinks this relation is possible but has yet to be proved. </seg>
<seg id=19> But no matter what the reason, the coming winter in North, Middle and West America will be a colder one with more snowfall compared with last winter. </seg>
