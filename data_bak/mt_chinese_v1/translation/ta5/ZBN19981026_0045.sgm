</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Detroit, Telegram) The Hudson Mansion with a history of 107 years became a pile of ruins in 30 seconds the day before yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> This reinforced steel frame building had 25 floors. It was the highest building to ever be fixed-point blasted with plastic explosives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hudson Mansion was once the world's largest retail store. It was also the landmark of Detroit city.  </seg>
<seg id=5> With the sound of the blast of 1,215 kg of plastic explosives, the building was finally reduced to 360,000,000 kg of rubble.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At 5:45 pm local time, a series of inward explosions took place at Hudson Mansion. The thick dust became a huge foggy ball, swallowing onlookers completely.  </seg>
<seg id=7> A city resident said: "I really didn't expect to get black all over by dust." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> At the time the mansion collapsed, some onlookers cheered loudly, while others wiped tears as they would never again see the building with which they are so familiar.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> During the period of great prosperity in the 1950s, about 100,000 people went shopping at Hudson Mansion every day.  </seg>
<seg id=10> At the time, famous movie stars such as Garbo and Parker visited the building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Detroit Mayor Archer once indicated to the public that government authorities were willing to offer the public the opportunity of operating the detonator in order to raise US$150,000 in charitable donations.  </seg>
<seg id=12> Nevertheless, since Hudson Mansion represents the past glory of Detroit, no one was willing to start the detonator and destroy the building in person.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> A man advocating keeping the building said: "This is a sad thing." </seg>
