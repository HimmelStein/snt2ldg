<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Bangkok, Telegram) The Thai Ministry of Communications announced yesterday that Thailand will ask Hopewell Group, a publicly-traded Hong Kong company that has contracted to construct a Bangkok elevated railway and highway system, for US$6.8 billion (about 11 billion Singapore dollars) in compensation for failure to perform the contract.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Paradi, vice minister of the Thai Ministry of Communications, says that the Thai Ministry of Communications and the National Railway Bureau have the right to demand Hopewell Group to pay for the loss of 6.8 billion US dollars caused by the delay of the project. Thailand has criticized Hopewell Group for having completed only 12% of the original project over the past 8 years.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Hopewell Group has negotiated with Thai authorities regarding financial disputes and disputed progress in land requisition that have intensified due to the devaluation of the Thai currency following the economic crisis in Thailand. The Thai government canceled the contract with Hopewell Group in January.  </seg>
<seg id=5> For this reason, Hopewell Group has demanded that the Thai government provide 100 billion Thai baht (about 4.2 billion Singapore dollars) to compensate the company for capital already invested and the portion of the project already completed over the past 8 years.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The Thai government said yesterday that Thailand is planning to restart this US$3.2 billion project but is considering reducing the scope of the project.  </seg>
<seg id=7> In any case, the government will not allow Hopewell Group to participate in the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Paradi said that the German government and Germany Reconstruction Bank (KFW) are interested in reviving this huge project, and have decided to provide 100 million Thai baht for a feasibility study of the Bangkok overhead railway and highway system.  </seg>
