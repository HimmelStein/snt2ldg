<seg id=4> The person in charge of the Chinese National Economy and Trade Committee, Sheng Huaren, has indicated that the Chinese armed forces will completely disassociate themselves from all of their subordinate companies and enterprises prior to December 20. </seg>
<seg id=5> All other party government and judicial departments must also take similar measures from the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> In July of this year, Chinese National Chairman Jiang Zemin ordered the military and armed police forces to stop managing businesses, hotels, and other commercial facilities to check the phenomena of corruption and smuggling that are spreading daily in the military. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren has indicated that as of now, in Shanghai and Tianjin, a number of military subordinate enterprises have been transferred to the control of local government, but it has not been made clear whether the military will receive compensation. </seg>
<seg id=8> In addition to the military being required to surrender control of subordinate businesses, party government and judicial departments will no longer be allowed to manage subordinate state-run business enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=9> Chinese state-run businesses have more than 100 million employees.  Due to severe problems of bad debts and dead accounts, as well as weak export markets due to the global economic crisis, many state-run enterprises are in reality on the verge of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren stated that the current number of personnel at many state-run enterprises is ten times the number actually needed, making the losses at these enterprises over the past year even more severe. </seg>
<seg id=11> This clearly shows that increasing the competitive strength of state-run enterprises has already become an urgent matter. </seg>
<seg id=12> Additionally, analysts indicate that government agencies and judicial departments in charge of state-run enterprises are commonly corrupt and do not manage well. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most commonly seen situation is where many government officials in charge of a certain industry are simultaneously in charge of managing businesses in that industry. </seg>
<seg id=14> They can thus use their functions and powers to provide their businesses with contracts, loans, and preferential tax treatment. </seg>
<seg id=15> This phenomenon has destroyed fair competition in the market and thus interfered with the transformation of China from a planned economy to a free market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> Based on reports, the 500 largest state-run enterprises originally under the party government and judicial departments will be controlled by a committee newly established by the State Council and the staff and workers of these enterprises will be determined by a personnel department. </seg>
<seg id=17> Somewhat smaller enterprises will be managed by local government. </seg>
<seg id=18> Financial and investment companies will be uniformly controlled by the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> At present, it is still not clear whether these changes mean that the government will decrease the amount of loans it provides to state-run enterprises, causing some of the larger enterprises to steadily move toward bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts believe that out of fear that a high unemployment rate might bring social unrest, China might rely chiefly on merger as opposed to bankruptcy to solve the problem of losses in state-run enterprises. </seg>
