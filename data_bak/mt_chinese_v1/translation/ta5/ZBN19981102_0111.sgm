<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Lisbon, Telegram) According to information disclosed by a reliable source, Portuguese Foreign Minister Gamma will meet with a UN official in Vienna tomorrow to discuss a report of excessive Indonesian troops in East Timor.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Sassar, spokesperson for Gamma, said that the report is not in compliance with the guarantee made by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ardalas to Gamma and the UN Secretary General in August.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Sassar stated that Ardalas guaranteed that the number of Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor would be gradually reduced.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It has been learned that Gamma will discuss related developments with Mark, special representative of Annan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to a secret document that obviously belongs to the Indonesian military sector but is circulating among foreign journalists, there were 17,834 Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor as of the end of July.  </seg>
<seg id=7> Embassies of Western countries said that this number is quite close to what they have estimated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> However, General Wiranto, commander-in-chief of Indonesia's armed forces, said that the number of 17,000 troops is "a lie." </seg>
<seg id=9> He did not disclose the real number. However, military officers once indicated that there were about 11,500 soldiers garrisoned in East Timor in August.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Indonesia dispatched troops to East Timor in 1975 and annexed East Timor a year later.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> However, the United Nations still maintains that only Lisbon is the official governing nation of East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=12> The UN Secretary General has been sponsoring peace talks between Portugal and Indonesia since 1983.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> East Timorese leaders, including Nobel Prize winner Belo and jailed East Timor independence movement guerrilla force leader Gusman, have all made statements supporing related reports and refuting Jakarta's claim of troop reduction in East Timor.  </seg>
