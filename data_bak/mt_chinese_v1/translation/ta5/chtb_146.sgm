<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 6, Telegram (Reporter Zhou Xisheng):  The U.S. Ambassador to China, Shang Mujie, gave a speech at a luncheon held by the U.S.-China Relations National Committee in New York on the 6th, appealing to the U.S. to "use strategic vision and adopt a continued, reliable and constructive China policy" and use honest comprehensive dialog to solve disputes regarding certain issues with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Shang Mujie pointed out that the U.S. should correctly face the rise of China on the international stage.  Regardless of whether at the end of this century or the beginning of the next, the U.S. should see the development of stable, healthy relations with China as a major opportunity afforded to foreign policy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When speaking on Chinese human rights and intellectual property rights, the ambassador pointed out that China had already made great progress in these regards. </seg>
<seg id=5> He felt that the freedom and democracy currently enjoyed by the Chinese people are unprecedented, and that China has already assumed an actively cooperative attitude in protecting intellectual property rights; the U.S. should not ignore this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Shang Mujie also suggested that once China has entered the WTO, the U.S. Congress should do away with the annual review of most favored nation status and grant China permanent most favored nation status. </seg>
<seg id=7> He pointed out that the annual debate of this issue by the U.S. Congress was actually disadvantageous only to the U.S. itself, affecting the investment confidence of U.S. businessmen in China and thus affecting American employment opportunities. </seg>
