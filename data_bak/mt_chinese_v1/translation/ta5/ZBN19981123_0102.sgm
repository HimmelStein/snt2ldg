<seg id=1> Philippine Foreign Minister: No Hope for Cambodia to Accede to ASEAN Next Month </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Manila, Telegram) Philippine Foreign Minister Siason said the day before yesterday that there is no hope for Cambodia to accede to ASEAN during the ASEAN summit meeting to be held next month in Hanoi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Siason said that even if opposing Cambodian parties form a coalition government before the summit meeting, Cambodia will not automatically become a member state of ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said: "Many ASEAN member states cannot come to a decision. </seg>
<seg id=5> Currently, many issues still exist, and Cambodia's political process is still underway. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accept them as a new member now and they fight again afterwards, we will have to solve the problem once again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdula said that Cambodia's accession to ASEAN depends on whether or not it can establish a legitimate government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Siason said: "People say, weren't we burnt once? At that time, we were ready to accept them. But a few days later, they fought again." </seg>
<seg id=9> He was apparently referring to what happened in April 1997 when Cambodia was close to accession to ASEAN.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The main reason Cambodia's accession to ASEAN turned out to be a bubble at that time was that Hun Sen used force to overthrow Prince Ranarith. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Hun Sen's Cambodia People's Party won the July election. However, the party was unable to obtain 2/3 majority in the legislative assembly necessary to rule the state independently.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen and Ranarith reached an agreement for form a coalition government. But the new government has not really been established. </seg>
