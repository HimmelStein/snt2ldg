<seg id=1> American Multinational Company to Set Up 300-Store Chain of Supermarkets in Fujian Province </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua Press Agency, Xiamen, January 16 (Reporter Xu Yingrui) Two convenience marts named "Beishun" separately opened for business here today. </seg>
<seg id=3> This marked the official start of the Xiamen Fulan Puli Supermarket Co., Ltd., 60 percent of the stock of which is held by the large U.S. multinational group, Bichunshi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Xiamen Fulan Puli Supermarket Co., Ltd.-- a cooperative effort between three parties consisting of U.S. Bichunshi International Industrial Group, China Xiamen Foreign Supply Controlling Company, and Philippine Feili Global International Company -- is the first retail business Chinese-foreign joint capital enterprise in Fujian Province. </seg>
<seg id=5> According to the agreement, the total investment in this project is about US$26 million, with first period investment being US$10 million.  Twenty exemplary convenience chain stores and a modern distribution center are to be opened in the city of Xiamen, and as the market develops, a total of 300 convenience chain stores are to be successively opened in nine areas and cities in Fujian Province. </seg>
<seg id=6> These stores are generally located in densely populated areas, are about 400 square meters in size, and sell articles of daily use closely related to the lives of city residents as well as main and secondary food items. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The U.S. Bichunshi International Industrial Corporation is a large multinational food corporation with annual sales exceeding US$2.1 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The steps in opening up the China retail industry have been relatively circumspect.  At present, only Beijing, Qingdao, Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Shanghai, and the like have been made test points.  The plan for developing chain stores in China of the U.S. Bichenshi International Industrial Corporation represents a rather large movement in the entry of foreign investment into the China retail industry. </seg>
