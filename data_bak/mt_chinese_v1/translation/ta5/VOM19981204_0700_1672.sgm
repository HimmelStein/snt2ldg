<seg id=1> Now let's take a look at Canada. </seg>
<seg id=2> Canadian International Trade Minister Machi has indicated that while exporting trade products, Canada should also export its value system to promote improvement of the human rights situtation in China and other Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id=3> Machi made this statment in response to a suggestion by the Canadian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee that trade should be linked to human rights. </seg>
<seg id=4> Now lets hear a report filed from Toronto by Voice of America reporter Yan Ming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Canadian Foreign Trade Minister Machi made an extremely enthusiastic response to the suggestion that trade and human rights issues should be linked that was presented in a report by the Canadian Parliament Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </seg>
<seg id=6> Machi indicated that human rights should be made a new factor and incorporated into Canadian foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=7> A report in the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said that Canadian Federal International Trade Minister Machi made this statement while attending an international trade conference in Ottawa on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id=8> Machi has indicated that while participating in the APEC summit meeting in Malaysia not long ago, what he saw there and the arrests over the past few days by Chinese authorities of dissidents and the like have made him firmly believe that regardless of whether providing economic assistance or conducting international trade, Canada should export its value system while exporting its products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Human rights and social justice should become an important part of Canadian foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Canada News Agency reports that the Canadian Senate Foreign Relations Committee report suggests that the Canadian government reevaluate all foreign aid items and endeavor to promote improvement in the local human rights situation while at the same time helping countries to develop economically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> A report in the National Post says that various signs indicate that the Canadian government is currently attempting to adjust its policies toward Asian countries, including China, and that the report of the Parliament Senate Foreign Relations Committee is just one signal. </seg>
<seg id=12> On Thursday, Canadian Foreign Relations Minister Auxworthy indicated in Ottawa that Canada is highly concerned about Chinese arrests of dissidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said, We must respond to this incident. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have already indicated to the Chinese government that arresting persons holding different political views is a violation of the United Nations Convention on Civil and Political Rights to which China is a signatory. </seg>
<seg id=15> The Canada News Agency report states that in reality, during a visit to China last month, Canadian Prime Minister Chretien changed the policy of not openly criticizing China that had been in place for more than two years, criticizing China's human rights record several times in public fora. </seg>
<seg id=16> Such unusual behavior by the Canadian Prime Minister has actually already explained some of the change in Canadian foreign policity. </seg>
<seg id=17> The National Post report says that the response of Canadian businessmen to the attitude of International Trade Minister Maqi in support of linking trade and human rights has been varied. </seg>
<seg id=18> Some people are privately worried that this will affect the business of large Canadian enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, Doctor Zhu Yuchao of Aukenagen University in the Canadian province of British Columbia sees things quite differently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> For North American capital... quite...because they have shifted their investment to East Asia, building factories and conducting trade.  One of the main reasons for this is to make money, there has to be profit.  </seg>
<seg id=21> However, when entering these East Asian countries, they can take certain standards, for example, worker protection, the protection of workers, worker benefits, these standards, and environmental protection demands, these standards can be taken to these countries, its a two-way street.... </seg>
<seg id=22> Further, this type of, this person taking it with him, has a demonstrative effect on improving local human rights, has a direct effect on this type of worker rights, this thing, has an extremely direct effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=23> This ends the report filed in Toronto by Voice of America special reporter Yan Ming. </seg>
