<seg id=1> A U.S. arms control delegation travelling Beijing to discuss the issue of the rapid entry of China into the Guided Missile Technology Control Agreement believes that China may still be continuing to export guided missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Below, please listen to the comprehensive report of Voice of America reporter Fang Yuan. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> A group of U.S. officials led by U.S. State Department Acting Assistant Secretary of State Holem conducted a day and a half of talks on the issue of the entry of China into the Guided Missile Technology Control Agreement with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, the Assistant Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese Armed Forces Xiong Guangkai, and other Chinese arms control experts. </seg>
<seg id=4> The discussions focused mainly on how to implement the indications made by Chinese National Chairman Jiang Zemin during the visit of President Clinton to China in June of this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> At the time, Jiang Zemin indicated that China would consider entry into the Guided Missile Technology Control Agreement, which is already considered to be one of the main results of the U.S.-China summit conference. </seg>
<seg id=6> One of the members of the U.S. delegation told Associated Press that the U.S. has certain doubts as to whether China is still exporting guided missile parts and components or guided missile technology, and Pakistan and Iran are two of the beneficiaries of Chinese exports of guided missile technology. </seg>
<seg id=7> The official said that the U.S. continues to raise this issue with China, and he believes China is now taking measures to resolve it. </seg>
<seg id=8> Chinese exports of guided missile technology have been a constant source of friction in Sino-U.S. relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Even since India and Pakistan, long-standing enemies on the Indian subcontinent, conducted nuclear testing one after the other in the first half of this year, the U.S. has felt a particular need for China to promise not to transfer guided missile technology because Pakistan, one of the contestants in the nuclear race on the Indian subcontinent, is a long-term ally of China. </seg>
<seg id=10> As early as 1993, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against China because China sold guided missile parts and technology to Pakistan. Only when China guaranteed that it would stop exporting ground-to-ground missiles did the U.S. lift the sanctions against China in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=11> The U.S. is also concerned that guided missile transactions between China and Iran will constitute a severe threat to U.S. allies and U.S. interests in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the U.S. official who revealed this information was not willing to explain in detail what type of guided missile technology China has provided to Pakistan and Iran and when this technology was provided. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said there is currently not enough evidence to prove that China is actually exporting guided missile technology to these two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> In the past, when the U.S. has obtained evidence that China has exported guided missile technology to these two countries, China has usually either denied it or said that the technology is dual-use technology and that the technology that has been exported is being used for peaceful objectives. </seg>
<seg id=15> China has to-date not publicly responded to the words of the U.S. delegation officials. </seg>
<seg id=16> Additionally, based on a AP report from Beijing, Washington has already officially confirmed that the country that helped Pakistan produce the Korea Model guided missile and fire it this April was not China but North Korea. </seg>
