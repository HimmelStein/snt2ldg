</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Associated Press, Lisbon, Telegram) The Portuguese Chief Procurator's Office said the day before yesterday that the General Procuratorate is studying the demand of a Portuguese congressman that former Indonesian President Suharto be extradited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Congressman Kreya Silva said in a letter that Suharto should be extradited because of his violation of human rights in East Timor. </seg>
<seg id=4> Indonesia invaded the Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 and annexed East Timor into the territory of Indonesia several weeks later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sara Pina, spokeswoman for the General Procuratorate, said: "We are studying the case to see if it is possible to do so under Portuguese law." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Human right organizations condemn the conduct of the Indonesian army in violating human rights in East Timor.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Silva said that the recent possibility that former Chilean dictator Pinochet may be extradited to Spain to face genocide and massacre charges has reinforced his determination to extradite Suharto.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Currently, Pinochet is in London, awaiting the decision of the House of Lords on whether or not he will be extradited.  </seg>
<seg id=9> The British High Court revoked the initial arrest warrant for Pinochet, explaining that as a former state leader, Pinochet enjoys immunity from charges.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Silva is a member of the Populace Party, a right-wing party in Portugal. </seg>
<seg id=11> He said that the United Nations still regards Portugal as the legitimate governing nation of East Timor, which is helpful to them in demanding the extradition of Suharto. </seg>
