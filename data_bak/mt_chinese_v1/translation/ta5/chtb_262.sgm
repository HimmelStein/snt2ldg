<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 1, Telegram (Reporter Yuan Yanghe).  Professor Liu Yuyi, who caused a sensation throughout the art circle with his famous oil painting "Fine Night", displayed "Divine Land Five-Unique Pebble" he discovered to public in Nanjing the other day.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The shape and size of this Yuhua pebble is exactly like a long live lock, a folk mascot.  </seg>
<seg id=4> Right in the middle of the Yuhua pebble is the image of a very clear map of the People's Republic of China.  </seg>
<seg id=5> The image stands tall and erect on both ends, and caves in the middle. The right bottom of the image sticks out, making the image look like a rooster throwing out its chest and craning its neck to crow. On the belly side of the "rooster" separated by a "strait" is the long and narrow "Taiwan Island". Underneath the feet of the "rooster" is the round-shaped "Hainan Island".  </seg>
<seg id=6> The colors of the two "islands" are exactly the same as that of the "mainland".  </seg>
<seg id=7> The whole image is exactly like the map of China.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Professor Liu Yuyi said that he picked up this Yuhua pebble on the road of a Yuhua pebble processing plant in the suburb of Nanjing five years ago. He carefully examined the pebble at home and discovered the "territory of China" on the pebble. </seg>
<seg id=9> Meanwhile, he also discovered an entrenched gigantic dragon holding a bright pearl in the mouth above the territory of the mainland and along the northeast, north, and northwest national territory lines. There is a shoe-shaped golden yellow light spot above the gigantic dragon. In the middle part of the territory of China, there is a string of torch-shaped stripes, symbolizing the ever-burning life fire of the Chinese nation. All these features, together with the shape looking like a long life lock, make five unique characteristics of the pebble. </seg>
<seg id=10> Based on these unique characteristics, Liu Yuyi named the pebble as the "Divine Land Five-Unique Pebble". </seg>
