<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Bangkok, Telegram) Thai Finance Minister Tarin left for Tokyo yesterday to discuss the Thai portion of the US$30 billion (48.6 billion Singapore dollars) that have been offered by Japan in an effort to save the Asian economy caught in the financial crisis.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said that during his four-day visit to Japan, he will engage in in-depth discussions. However, he is unable to predict the amount of money Japan will agree to provide Thailand.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Tarin told reporters at Bangkok International Airport: "I reported an outline for use of the loan to premier Chuan Leekpai last night. However, we have not decided on the amount of the loan as Japan has not yet informed us." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said that he hopes to obtain a low interest rate and generous payback terms from this program.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He added that he will hold separate meetings with officials from the Japan Ministry of Trade and Industry to discuss the new aid to support the regrouping of Thai industry and agriculture.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Japan Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced the 30 billion US dollar rescue loan package at the G7 Conference held on October 3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Within a short period, Japan will appropriate US$15 billion to support such areas as trade and financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Japan will provide direct financial assistance by providing loans and purchasing Asia bonds through the Japan Import-Export Bank, and will provide Asian countries with development and aid loans in Japanese currency. </seg>

<seg id=12> Thailand plans to use this money to inject more capital into its economy.  </seg>
<seg id=13> The Thai economy has been hard hit by high borrowing and lending costs as well as storms in new developed global markets. </seg>
