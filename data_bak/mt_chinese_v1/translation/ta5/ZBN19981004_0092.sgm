</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Sydney, Telegram), Tayi Mamu, chief officer of the Malasian State of Sarawak, says that detained former Vice Premier of Malaysia Anwa has very likely committed all of the crimes charged against him, including sodomy.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> During an interview with Australian newspapers yesterday, he said that he is "rather familiar" with Anwa, and he believes that Anwa is extremely likely to be found guilty of all charges brought against him.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said: "I am aware of the charges he faces. </seg>
<seg id=5> I think there is a significant possibility that he will be found guilty of the charges." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Anwa was arrested under the Internal Security Law on September 20 after he launched a series of demonstrations calling for reform following his dismissal from his post in early September. He was charged on ten counts, consisting of five counts of sodomy and five counts of corruption. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> When he appeared for the first time in nine days after police detained him on Tuesday, his left eye was swollen and his hands showed wounds. He denied all the charges in court.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Tayi is currently attending an international alumni meeting in Adelaide. </seg>
<seg id=9> He indicated that he has not been in contact with Anwa recently. However, he is not worried about Anwa's situation, nor is he worried that Anwa may not obtain a fair hearing.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> He said: "the law is just and fair; if he is innocent, I believe he will be released. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, if he is guilty, he should be punished just like other Malaysian citizens." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Tayi also attributes recent events that have tarnished Malaysia's international image to Anwa. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said: "I think that what is harmful to our image is not that the events happened here, but the remarks he made." </seg>
