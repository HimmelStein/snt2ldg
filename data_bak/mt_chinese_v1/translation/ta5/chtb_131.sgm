<seg id=2> Xinhua Press Agency, Abidjan, January 18, Telegram (Reporter Linghu Daocheng) Ivoirian Minister of Economy and Finance Engelan said here on the 17th that the economies of the member states of the West African Economic and Currency Union are clearly enjoying growth recovery, with major economic components in good condition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Engelan said at a summit of economists held by a French-Ivoirian Businessmen's Club that the average annual economic growth rate of the economies of the member states of the West African Economic and Currency Union recovered to about 5.9 percent in 1996 and grew to 6.3 percent in 1997, while the growth rate in 1994 was only 2.6 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that West African countries have made great efforts in recent years to improve imbalances in imports and exports and the state of public investment, causing a large increase in the trade surplus.  At the same time, budget deficits have markedly shrunk, amounting to only 1.3 percent of the gross domestic products of the various countries. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> When speaking about the affect on the West African franc (African franc) of the European joint currency system that the European Union is preparing to implement, Engelan indicated that people need not worry about the future of the African franc. </seg>
<seg id=6> He said that since economic growth has clearly recovered in the various countries of the West African Economic and Currency Union, he said that in the short run, the African franc could never depreciate by 50 percent again the way it did in January of 1994. </seg>
