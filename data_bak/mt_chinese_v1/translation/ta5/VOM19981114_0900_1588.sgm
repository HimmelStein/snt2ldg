<seg id=1> As far as the weather goes, we know that the consequences of the El Nino phenomenon last year included the huge continuous fires in Indonesia, flooding in the desert regions of Peru, and severe weather abnormalities in wide regions of the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the U.S., floods battered California and the southern states in the beginning of this year, after which numerous areas in the south suffered droughts. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to the experts, the El Nino phenomenon is turning into a new phenomenon called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> And La Nina will put on a frightening display next year no less devastating than that of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Please listen now to the report of Voice of America reporter Li Lan filed from Chicago, as broadcast by Qi Zhifeng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In Chicago, where the winters have always been cold, the winter was warmer last year than in the past and much less snow fell.  Next winter may be about the same.  </seg>
<seg id=7> At the same time, El Nino wreaked havoc in southeast Asia, the amount of rainfall decreased significantly, and drought caused wildfires that burned out of control for several weeks. </seg>
<seg id=8> El Nino and La Nina are both the results of large changes in the water surface temperature of the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino means that the water surface temperature is much higher than normal, which then affects air currents and, as they change, the weather in all regions of the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nina means that the water surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean is lower than normal, affecting the weather of many regions in a manner precisely the opposite of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=11> Weather expert Lafu of the U.S. National Weather Bureau says the huge fires in Indonesia may not get out of control next year because heavier rainfall than in past years is forecast for the area from December of this year through March of next year. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time, the temperature in western and southeastern Africa will be a little lower than usual, and the amount of rainfall in the northern part of South America will be comparatively high. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern half of the United States will be drier than in past years, meaning that the states of Texas and New Mexico may undergo continuous drought, and the chances of forest fires in Florida will be higher than usual. </seg>
<seg id=14> The torrential rains this year in California and the South regions were both bestowed by El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Lafu says El Nino will not produce rainstorms, but will provide the conditions for the formation of severe rainstorms. </seg>
<seg id=16> The summer this year has been one of the hottest on record for the U.S. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some people connect global warming with the El Nino phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lafu believes that such an association is possible, but has not yet been demonstrated. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, other reasons aside, this means that the north and west-central U.S. are in for a colder winter with more snowfall than last year. </seg>
