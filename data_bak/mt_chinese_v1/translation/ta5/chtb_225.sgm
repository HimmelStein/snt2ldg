Kraishnik, chairman of the parliament of "Serbia Republic" in Bosnia and Herzegovina, stressed when he made a statement to the newspaper "Voice of Serbia" that the leaders of Serbians in Bosnia and Herzegovina "can only negotiate on a new territory dividing plan, i.e., a new peace plan" after the Bosnia and Herzegovina territory dividing proposal presented by the Liaison Panel was rejected in a referendum.  </seg>
