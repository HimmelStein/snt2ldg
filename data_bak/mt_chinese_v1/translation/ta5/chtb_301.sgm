<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 1, Telegram (Reporter Zhang Youhao).  French national defense minister Leotar said on September 1 that France is studying the plan of withdrawing troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Leotar made the statement when he spoke to a radio station reporter in Paris. </seg>
<seg id=4> He pointed out that the U.S. suggestion of lifting the arms embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina means "the possible ending of international aid" and "breaking out of significant and open conflicts again", which will result in "serious consequences with great losses".  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Leotar said that "under the circumstance that the safety of the United Nations peace-keeping troops is not assured, we cannot accept the lifting of arms embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina".  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> French foreign affairs minister Jupet also indicated clearly last week that the "prerequisite of lifting the arms embargo is that France withdraws its blue-helmet troops and all the United Nations peace-keeping troops withdraw from the region". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since the broke-out of Bosnia and Herzegovina conflict in February 1992, France has been posting about 4000 military officers and soldiers.  </seg>
<seg id=8> It is a western country that dispatched the largest number of blue-helmet troops to the region.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The U.S. President Clinton claimed on August 10 that if Serbians in Bosnia and Herzegovina still do not accept the five-nation peace plan, he will urge the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution to cancel the arms embargo to  Bosnia and Herzegovina. If the U.N. Security Council fails to pass such a resolution, he will seek to unilaterally lift the arms embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina.  </seg>
