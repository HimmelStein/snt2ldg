<seg id=2> This paper, Beijing, January 5, Dispatch, Reporter He Huangbiao reports:  The high-tech enterprise Wangma Computer Company of Zhongguan Village in Beijing announced at a news conference held at the Great Hall of the People on January 4th that to meet the urgent office automation needs of various departments of the Party, government, and military, it had decided to "open up to the public" within China in the form of unencrypted floppy disks and without technology fees a set of "Wangma Precision Software" that it had determined would generate a profit of more than 1 million yuan.  This would allow any microcomputer user to copy and use the software. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Wangma Computer Company achieved fame through a Chinese character coding method known as the "five-stroke character pattern" invented by the well-known computer expert, Wang Yongmin. </seg>
<seg id=4> This convenient, highly efficient input method already covers more than 85 percent of users throughout the country and has become a Chinese character input method giving China a leading position. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, with the rapid development of the computer industry, more and more computer users have come forward to "line up and register," purchasing the new version of the "five-stroke character pattern" and the Wangma Chinese character operating system. </seg>
<seg id=6> To benefit society, the Wangma Computer Company has forgone this chance to make a big profit and given unencrypted floppy disks to users, allowing them to make copies themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Participating leaders, experts, and users at the meeting gave Wangma Computer Company high marks for its decision to make the unselfish donation. </seg>
