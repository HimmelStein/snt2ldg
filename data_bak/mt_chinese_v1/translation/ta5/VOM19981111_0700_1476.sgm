<seg id=1> Representatives participating in the United Nations Global Weather Conference being held in the Argentinean capital, Buenos Aires, are continuing their work. </seg>
<seg id=2> At the same time, the U.S. Congress is debating whether or not it should approve the agreement reached last year in Kyoto, Japan. </seg>
<seg id=3> Another report sent from Buenos Aires by Voice of America reporter Fulaikusi says that several members of the U.S. Congress brought the debate to the conference hall in Buenos Aires.  </seg>
<seg id=4> Now please listen to the detailed contents of the report broadcast to you by Ma Kaiyue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Democratic U.S. Senators Lieberman and Kerry made statements on Tuesday in Buenos Aires urging the Clinton Administration to sign and approve this week the agreement reached at Kyoto. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two senators both stated that this would strengthen the persuasive power of the U.S. representative and make developing countries more likely to promise to work on the issue of reducing the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions. </seg>
<seg id=7> This is actually a necessary requirement that has been presented in several past proposals in the Senate. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, several members of the U.S. House of Representatives present in Buenos Aires say that they object to the Clinton Administration taking any such action. </seg>
<seg id=9> Republican Congressman from Wisconsin and Chair of the Congressional Science Task Force Committee Sensenbrenner said that the Kyoto Agreement has fatal flaws and will certainly be voted down by the U.S. Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Sensenbrenner said that just as the agreement has currently been set aside, the agreement was dead when it was sent to the Senate, and the U.S. Senate will not approve this agreement. </seg>
<seg id=12> The issue is what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> Should we try to save it, or should we announce that the agreement has fatal flaws and should be renegotiated. </seg>
<seg id=14> Congressman Sensenbrenner said that this is not a partisan factional dispute either in the U.S. House of Representatives or the Senate, which has been indicated by several well-known Democratic members of Congress. </seg>
<seg id=15> Democratic Congressman from Pennsylvania Kelinke says that he opposes this agreement because it would reduce employment opportunities, and reduce what he calls the degree of U.S. industrialization. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Democratic Congressman from Ohio Kuqinqi does not agree with the viewpoint of Sensenbrenner, comparing the fight against the global warming phenomenon with the struggle for world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said the same resolve will enable the Kyoto Agreement to achieve victory. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> I hope this process will continue, and at the same time, we should not, because of the stubbornness of some Congressional representatives, neglect the necessity of achieving a global solution, regardless of whether the U.S. Congress participates. </seg>
<seg id=20> In the main conference hall at Buenos Aires, the representatives are currently discussing a variety of issues, some of which will have to be left to the energy and environmental ministers of the 160 participating countries to resolve on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id=21> The U.S. representative said that although some of the issues of comparative concern to the U.S. Congress may be deferred to the next conference for resolution, some progress has been made at the current conference. </seg>
