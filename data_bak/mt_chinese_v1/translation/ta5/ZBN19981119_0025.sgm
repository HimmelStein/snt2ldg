<seg id=1> Lien Hoe Expects to Redeem Outstanding 65% of Bond by End of Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur, Message) The Lien Hoe Group expects to redeem the outstanding 65% of a bond, equivalent to 53.81 million ringgit, by the end of the year by obtaining bank loans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The total value of the 6% interest, redeemable, guaranteed bond issued by Lien Hoe Group was 85.74 million ringgit. The maturity date was August 17, 1998. </seg>
<seg id=4> As Lien Hoe Group could only redeem 35% of the bond at maturity due to a drop in the real estate market and a contraction in floating capital, the maturity date of the remaining 65% of the bond was extended to August 17, 2000, at an annual interest rate of 15%.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Securities Exchange Supervisory Commission approved last month the extension of the bond maturity date to August 17, 2000, by Lien Hoe Group. The Group is also the first domestic company to receive approval to extend a bond maturity date. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In view of the current drop in market interest rates, Lien Hoe Group plans to redeem the remainder of the bond through bank loans without paying the higher 15% annual interest rate to bond holders.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Zeng Hualong, the company's directing manager, indicated that since current interest rates have dropped and the new financial budget act is favorable to growth in the real estate industry, it is expected that in the second half of the year Lien Hoe Group will be able to reverse its weak position of the first half of the year and perform well. </seg>
