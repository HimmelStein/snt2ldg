<seg id=1> Thousands of British Immigrants Leave Australia Thinking They Were Discriminated Against by Natives </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Sydney, Telegram)  A survey published yesterday reveals that thousands of British immigrants have decided to leave Australia because of a "mentality of hostility toward the British" and discrimination by natives,. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The British Immigration Association has appealed to the government to face up to this problem for the economic benefit of local immigrants and Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hunt, chairman of the Association, points out that the British feel Australians have a "mentality of hostility toward the British," and that the Australian economy "is very likely losing several million dollars a year because of this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He points out that it is disappointing that so many British people choose to leave Australia because those who leave are almost all skilled workers who are economically independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told a reporter: "Based on local immigration regulations, these immigrants are not the type that you want to get rid of." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> British immigrants account for 14% of the Australian immigrant population. </seg>
<seg id=8> Nevertheless, statistical data from the Department of Immigration show that although 11,978 new British immigrants came to Australia between 1996 and 1997, 3,737 people left during the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Hunt says the Association discovered after an investigation it conducted in Melbourne that one out of four British immigrants believes that they are discriminated against in Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 40% of those interviewed thought that natives are preferential to non-British people. </seg>
<seg id=11> Some 37% of those interviewed pointed out that complaints from British immigrants were not treated as seriously as complaints from other nationalities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> About 35% of those interviewed blamed the media as being the chief culprit in creating prejudice in natives against British immigrants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Hunt says that the anti-British stance of Australian former Prime Minister Keating also played a negative role.  </seg>
