<seg id=1> Philippines Charge that Malaysia Attempted to Occupy A Philippino Reef </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Reported by Manila correspondent Fei Nande </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Philippino officials consider Malaysia to be another country in addition to China that constitutes a potential threat to the Philippines on the Nansha Islands.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A document from Philippino military intelligence shows that Malaysian troops once attempted to occupy a reef belonging to the Philippines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The document said that Malaysia's attempt to occupy the Philippino Reef may constitute a security problem as the reef is geographically close to Palawan Island in the Philippines.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The document does not specify when the event occurred, nor does it explain why the attempt by the Malaysian troops failed.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Philippino military officers said in an interview with a reporter earlier that Malaysia's attempt to occupy the reef occurred in August, or several months before the Philippines discovered the activities of the Chinese navy on the Meiji Reef.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They explained that timely "persuasion" by Philippino authorities has prevented Malaysia from promoting its plans in the region. However, personnel from the Philippino National Defense Ministry did not provide details. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Before the Philippino military disclosed that Malaysia had attempted to occupy a Philippino reef, Philippino President Estrada turned down the suggestion by the military that the Philippino reef be controlled.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> In the same report, the military claims that China is using the facility it built on the Meiji Reef as a "springboard" to prepare to eventually occupy the nearby Reed Shoal and conduct petroleum exploration.  </seg>
