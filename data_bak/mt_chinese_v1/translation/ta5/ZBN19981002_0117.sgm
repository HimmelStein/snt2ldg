<p>
<seg id=2> (France News Agency, Jakarta, Telegram) The "Journalist Protection Committee," an international organization dedicated to the defense of freedom of the press, expressed astonishment that Indonesian police would summon a reporter for having covered the rape of Chinese women during the May riots. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Journalist Protection Committee, with an office in New York, says that Gunawan, a journalist working for the "Jakarta-Jakarta" magazine, was summoned to police headquarters for questioning on Thursday.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Committee says that Gunawan quoted a woman who had been raped in a report published in July.  </seg>
<seg id=5> The words from the same victim were also quoted in a report published by the New York Times on June 10.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In a letter to Indonesian President Habibie, the Committee said that the issuing of a summons is the "first step taken by the police in filing charges." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The Committee "is very worried that the invocation of such laws will have a  negative impact on freedom of the press." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> What the Committee is refering to is that Indonesian Muslim organizations put pressure on the government, demanding that it arrest Gunawan under Article 156 of the Criminal Code. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The Alliance of International Independent Journalists also protested the summoning of Gunawan by the Indonesian police. </seg>
<seg id=11> It said that this will "set a precedent in weakening the more extensive freedom of the press that has been enjoyed by the media since former President Suharto stepped down."  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> The Journalist Protection Committee urged Habibie to "stop countering Gunawan" and asked the parties concerned to settle the dispute in civil court. </seg>
<seg id=13> The Committee also appealed to all parties to "do their best to get the defamation article in Indonesia's Criminal Code abolished." </seg>
