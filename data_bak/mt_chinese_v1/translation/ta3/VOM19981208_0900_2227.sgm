<seg id=4> Sheng Huaren, chief of China State Economic and Trade Commission indicates that Chinese army will be completely separated from the domination to their subordinate enterprises and companies before December 20. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other Party, government, and judicatory departments must take similar action at the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Chinese President Jiang Zemin commanded in July this year that, army, and armed police must stop running enterprises, hotels, and other commercial establishments so that to control the wide spread corruption and smuggling within the army. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren indicated that, up to now, some enterprises dominated by army in Shanghai and Tianjin have been shifted to be under the leadership of local government. But he does not explain if the army will be compensated. </seg>
<seg id=8> Not only the army must hand over their control of the subordinate enterprises, Party, government, and judicatory departments will never manage their attached state-owned enterprises as well. </seg>
<seg id=9> There are more than 100 million employees in Chinese state-owned enterprises, due to serious bad debts, dead debts, and a weakened export market resulted from global economic crises etc, many state-owned enterprises are at the brink of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said, the employee numbers on roll book in many existing state-owned enterprises are over ten times as many as what these enterprises actually need, that makes those enterprises in a worse loss situation. </seg>
<seg id=11> This shows that enhancement of market competition power of state-owned enterprises has been a very urgent affair. </seg>
<seg id=12> On the other hand, the analysts indicate that the corruption and poor management widely exist in government and judicatory departments who administrate the state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common conditions are that many government officials who administrate an industry also take charge of the enterprises in the same industry. </seg>
<seg id=14> Therefore, they are able to take full advantage of their right or power to offer preferential conditions on contracts, loans, and taxes to these enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=15> These phenomena ruined the fair market competition; in turn it obstructed China's transformation of from planned economy to market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> It is understood that, over 500 largest state-owned enterprises originally attached to the Party, government, and judicatory departments will be supervised by a newly established commission under the State Council, and the employees of these enterprises will be arranged by personal departments. </seg>
<seg id=17> The smaller enterprises will be administrated by the local government. </seg>
<seg id=18> And the financial and investment companies will be administrated and controlled unitarily by Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> At present, it is not sure if the transformation means the country will reduce the loans to state-owned enterprises and make them gradually go bankrupt. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts think that because a high unemployment rate may cause social turbulence, China will solve the loss problem of state-owned enterprises in the way of merger instead of bankruptcy. </seg>
