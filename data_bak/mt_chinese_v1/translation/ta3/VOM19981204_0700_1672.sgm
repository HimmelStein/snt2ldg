<p>
<seg id=5> Canadian International Trade Minister Marchi responded very actively to a report proposed by Senate Foreign Affair Committee of Canadian Congress. This report suggested combining trade with human right. </seg>
<seg id=6> Marchi expressed that Canada should include human right in Canada's foreign trade policy as a new factor. </seg>
<seg id=7> A report of Ottawa Citizen newspaper said, Canadian Federal International Trade Minister Marchi made this remark when attending a meeting on foreign affair and international trade on Thursday in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id=8> Marchi said, both the local situation he saw during his participating in APEC summit conference in Malaysia not long ago, and China's arrest of persons with different political view in recent days made him believe firmly that Canada should export her values simultaneously with her products, no matter in offering economic aid or handling international trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The human right and social justice should be an important part in Canadian foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> According to Canadian Press, the report of Foreign Affair Committee of Canadian Senate suggested that Canadian government should re-examine and verify all the foreign aid projects, and strive to improve local human right status simultaneously when the economy of aid receiving countries develops. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> A report of National Post newspaper said, all signs indicated that Canadian government was trying to regulate her policy towards Asian countries including China, and the report of Foreign Affair Committee of Senate was just one of those signs. </seg>
<seg id=12> Canadian foreign minister Axworthy expressed on Thursday that Canada was very much concerned at China's arrest of persons with different political view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said, we must respond to this event. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have pointed out to Chinese government that the arrest of persons with different political view breached UN Civil Right and Political Right Convention signed by China. </seg>
<seg id=15> A report of Canadian Press said, as a matter of fact, during his visit to China last month, Canadian Prime Minister Chretien changed his usual way of not accuse China publicly and criticized China's human right records several times in public occasions. </seg>
<seg id=16> This unusual way of Canadian Prime Minister actually showed the changes in Canadian foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> The report of National Post newspaper said, the people in Canadian circle had different responses to International Trade Minister Marchi's support to the combining trade with human right. </seg>
<seg id=18> Some people showed their concern in private that this would affect the business of Canadian enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, Doctor Zhu Yuchao of Aucknagen University in British Columbia, Canada, has quite different idea. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> AS for the capital in North America, why they turn to East Asia to invest, to build factories, one of the important reasons is of course to earn money, yes, to have profit. </seg>
<seg id=21> But at the same time when they enter these East Asia countries, they can bring some standards, for example, the labor protection, yes, the labor protection, the labor welfare, and other standards, and also the requirement to environment protection and so on, to bring these standards to these countries, this is, bilateral. </seg>
<seg id=22> Moreover, for these, the man who bring these to them plays a role of good sample, to improve local human right, to improve directly the labor right, have, will have very direct affect. </seg>
