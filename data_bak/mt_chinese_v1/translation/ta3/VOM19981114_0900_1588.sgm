<seg id=1> From the meteorological information, we knew the results caused by El Nino phenomena last year, including continual violent fire in Indonesia, the deluge-flooded desert in Peru, and serious abnormal climate in wide areas all around the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> In America, at the beginning of this year, the flood attacked California and many states in southern area, and then drought hit many places in southern parts. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to meteorological specialists, the El Nino is changing into another new phenomenon called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> And next year, La Nina will have a frightening behavior at least as strong as El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Now, please listen to a report of VOA correspondent Li Lan from Chicago and read by Qi Zhifen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Last winter, it was much warmer than those usually freezing winters in Chicago and with less snow, and it could be very similar next winter. </seg>
<seg id=7> At the same time, El Nino swept fiercely in Southeast Asia, the rainfall greatly reduced and the drought resulted in a prairie fire burning for several weeks out of control. </seg>
<seg id=8> Both El Nino and La Nina are the result of a considerable temperature change in surface water in east Pacific Ocean in the Tropics. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino means the temperature of surface water in the ocean is much higher than usual, it will affect air current situation, and in turn it will change the climate in different regions in the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> While La Nina means the temperature of surface water in the ocean is much lower than usual, and its influence on many regional climate is just contrary to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=11> The climate specialist, Lavo, of U.S. National Bureau of Meteorology said that the big fire in Indonesia next year wouldn't be out of control because it was estimated that the rainfall in this area from December this year to March next year would be more than that in past years. </seg>
<seg id=12> Meanwhile, the temperature in west and southeast Africa will be a little lower than normal time, and rainfall in northern part of South America will be more. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern part of America will be drier than usual. It means there could be a lasting drought in Texas and New Mexico, and the possibility of big forest fire in Florida will be higher than normal. </seg>
<seg id=14> All the rainstorms in California and southern region this year were imputed to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Lavo said that the El Nino won't produce rainstorm itself, but it will offer conditions of forming the serious rainstorm. </seg>
<seg id=16> This summer is one of the hottest summers in U.S. </seg>
<seg id=17> Somebody connect global warming to El Nino phenomena. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lavo thinks it is possible, but has not been confirmed so far. </seg>
<seg id=19> But whatever the other reason is, it means the coming winter in north and middle west part of U.S. will be a much colder winter, a winter with more snow. </seg>
