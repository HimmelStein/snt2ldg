<seg id=1> Philippine Foreign Minister: No Hope to Join ASEAN Next Month for Cambodia </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence Francaise de Press, Manila) - Philippine Foreign Minister Siazon said the day before yesterday that it will be hopeless for Cambodia to join ASEAN during the ASEAN summit conference in Hanoi next month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Siazon said, even if the Cambodian hostile parties organized a coalition government before the summit conference, Cambodia would not become a member of ASEAN automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said: "Many ASEAN member countries hesitated about it. </seg>
<seg id=5> There are many problems; Cambodia's political progress is still going on. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accept them as new members now, and then they begin to fight again, we will have to solve this problem again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Malaysian foreign minister Abdullah said that Cambodia's joining of ASEAN depends on if it can set up a legal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Siazon said: "Someone says, were we deceived before? When we prepared to accept them but just after several days they began to fight again." </seg>
<seg id=9> He obviously meant the Cambodia was very close to joining of ASEAN in April of 1997. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> At that time, Cambodia's joining of ASEAN was just a visionary hope plan mainly because Hun Sun overthrew Prince Ranariddh by force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won the election in July this year. But this party could not get two third majority seats, which is necessary for exclusive reign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen has already reached an agreement with Ranariddh for organizing a coalition government, but the new government has not been established. </seg>
