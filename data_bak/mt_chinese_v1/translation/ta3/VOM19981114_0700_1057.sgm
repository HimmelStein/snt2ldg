<seg id=1> A U.S. arms control delegation, that is going to Beijing to discuss China's joining Missile Technology Control Agreement as early as possible, thinks that China is possibly still exporting her missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Now, please listen to the integral report of VOA correspondent Fang Yuan. </seg>

<seg id=3> A team of American officials headed by Holem, U.S. acting under Secretary of State, of American Department of State, held negotiation on China's joining of Missile Technology Control Agreement with Chinese Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of Chinese army, Xion Guangkai, and other Chinese arms control specialists. This negotiation lasted for one and half a day. </seg>
<seg id=4> The negotiation focused on how to realize Chinese President Jiang Zemin's expression made during President Clinton's visit to China in June this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> At that time, Jiang Zemin indicated that China would consider joining Missile Technology Control Agreement, and this was viewed as one of the major fruits of U.S. China summit meeting. </seg>
<seg id=6> A member of U.S. delegation denoted to Associated Press, that American side doubts if China still exports missile components and parts or missile technologies at present, while Pakistan and Iran are two beneficiary countries of China's exporting missile technologies. </seg>
<seg id=7> This official said U.S. side would keep on raising this issue to China and, he believed that China was also taking measures to solve these questions. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's exporting of missile technology is always an issue of friction between U.S. and China relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Since the nuclear tests performed by India and Pakistan, two old enemies on South Asia subcontinent, in succession during the first half of this year, U.S. has been particularly felt that it is necessary for China to make commitment on controlling of missile technical transfer. Because Pakistan, one of the two nuclear race opponents on South Asia subcontinent, is China's long-term allied country. </seg>
<seg id=10> As early in 1993, U.S. exerted economic sanction on China due to China's exporting missile components and technology to Pakistan. U.S. did not cancel the sanction to China until 1994 when China guaranteed to stop exporting ground-to-ground missile. </seg>
<seg id=11> U.S. is also worrying about the missile deal between China and Iran that will constitute a serious intimidation to America's allied countries in Middle East and U.S. benefit. </seg>
<seg id=12> But the U.S. official who revealed above information would not like to give detailed explanation for what kind of missile technology China provided to Pakistan and Iran and when did China do so. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said there is no enough evidence at present to support the conclusion that China exported missile technology to these two countries for sure. </seg>
<seg id=14> Every time when U.S. got evidence that indicating China's exporting of missile technology to these two countries before, China would always either deny it or say that the technology was so called dual-purpose technology, and the technology she exported was for peaceful purpose only. </seg>
<seg id=15> Chinese side has not made any public response so far to American delegation official's speech. </seg>
<seg id=16> According to another report of Associated Press from Beijing, Washington has confirmed the country that helped Pakistan to do R & D and launch Korean type missile in April was North Korea instead of China. </seg>
