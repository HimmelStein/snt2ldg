<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 6 (by Journalist Zhou Xisheng) - James Sasser, U.S. Ambassador to China, made a speech on a luncheon held by National Committee On US - China Relations on 6th in New York, appealing America to develop a "consistent, credible, and constructive policy toward China with a strategic point of view" and to solve the differences on some issues with China by frank and comprehensive dialogue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> James Sasser pointed out that U.S. should confront correctly China's development and emergence onto the world stage. Whenever during the end of this century or in the next, America should take advantage of this major foreign policy opportunity to develop a stable and healthy relation with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When talking about the issues of human right and protection of intellectual property rights, this ambassador pointed out, China has made considerable progress in these two aspects. </seg>
<seg id=5> He deemed that the liberties and democracy Chinese people have now are unprecedented in China before. China has also taken an active co-operative attitude in the protection of intellectual property rights. U.S. should not be blind to all of these. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> James Sasser added, U.S. Congress should cancel the annual debate on China's MFN position after her accession in WTO and give China permanent MFN treatment. </seg>
<seg id=7> He pointed out that the annual debate on this issue in U.S. Congress is actually harmful only to America herself. Because it will impact American businessmen's confidence for investment in China and in turn will affect American people's employment opportunities. </seg>
