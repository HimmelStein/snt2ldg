<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 1 (by journalist Zhang Youhao) - Leotard, French National Defense minister, said on September 1 that France is considering a plan to withdraw troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Leotard made the speech in Paris when he talking to a broadcast station journalist. </seg>
<seg id=4> He pointed out that America's proposal of lifting the ban of weapon embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina means "international aid could be ended" and "serious public conflict could break out again", and all those would lead to "a serious aftermath of great loss." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Leotard said, "Without the security guarantee to UN peace keeping force, we can not accept the lifting of weapon embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina." </seg>

<seg id=6> French Foreign Minister Jubei expressed last week that, the lifting of weapon embargo was "preconditioned with France's withdraw of her Blue Helmet troops and withdrawal of all UN peace keeping force." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since the conflict outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina in February 1992, France has kept about 4,000 troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. </seg>

<seg id=9> American President Clinton declared on August 10 that, if the Five-state Peace Scheme was not accepted by Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina by October 15, he would appeal the Security Council to approbate a resolution of lifting the ban of weapon embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina; if the Security Council was not able to approbate a resolution like this, he would seek to lifting the ban of weapon embargo to Bosnia and Herzegovina unilaterally by U.S. </seg>
