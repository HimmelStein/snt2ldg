<seg id=1> In Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, the representatives attending UN Global Climate Meeting continued their work. </seg>
<seg id=2> Meanwhile, the State Department of America is debating if they would approve the protocol reached in Tokyo meeting last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> VOA correspondent Fleikos said in his another report from Buenos Aires that, several American State Department senators brought this dispute to the meeting hall in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id=4> Please listen to the detailed report now by Ma Kaiyue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Democratic Party senators Lygoman and klee of American State Department made a statement on Tuesday in Buenos Aires to urge Clinton government to approve the protocol reached in Tokyo meeting within this week. </seg>
<seg id=6> Both senators indicated that this would make American representatives more convincing for developing countries to make commitment easily for reducing the emission of warm house effect waste gas. </seg>
<seg id=7> This was in fact a necessary condition in several proposals put forward before by senate. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some U.S. House Representatives in Buenos Aires said they had an objection to any similar action of Clinton government like this. </seg>
<seg id=9> Sensenbluna, Republican Party House Representative from Wisconsin and Chairman of Science Team Committee of House of Representative, said that there was a fatal defect in Kyoto Protocol that would be surely denied by U.S. Senate and the State Department. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said:" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Just like the protocol was laid aside at present. It was already dead when presented to the Senate. U.S. Senate and the State Department would not approve it. </seg>
<seg id=12> The question is what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> Try to remedy, or just declare the fatal defect of this protocol? We shall discuss again." </seg>
<seg id=14> House Representative Sensenbluna added: "This is not a party dispute between two parties in House of Representative and Senate of the Capital Hill." </seg>
<seg id=15> Democratic Party House representative Clinck from Pennsylvania said that he opposed this protocol because it would cut down job opportunities, and like he mentioned, the reduction of the industrialization degree of U.S.. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Kuchenki, Democratic Party House representative from Ohio, disagreed Sensenbluna's point of view, and did a comparison between fighting against the global warming and striving for world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said that the same determination would make Tokyo Protocol win. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> House Representative Kuchenki said:" I hope that this progress will go on. At the same time, we should not ignore the necessity of reaching a global resolution because of a certain senator's temporary persistence, no matter with or without participating of U.S. State Department." </seg>
<seg id=20> In the main meeting hall in Buenos Aires, representatives are discussing all kinds of issues; some of them certainly will be remained for 160 ministers of energy and environment from participating countries on Wednesday's meeting. </seg>
<seg id=21> The representatives from U.S. said, in spite of the fact that some issues concerned by U.S. State Department might be postponed to next annual meeting for solution, this meeting has got some progress. </seg>
