<p>
<seg id=2> (Agence Francaise de Press, Bangkok) - Thailand Ministry of Communications declared yesterday that Thailand will lodge a claim against Hong Kong listed company, Hopewell group, who contracted the construction of Bangkok overhead railway and highway system, to compensate 6.8 billion US dollars (about 11 billion Singapore dollars) for its delayed performance of the contract. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Parady, Vice Minister of Thailand Ministry of Communications said that Thailand Ministry of Communications and National Railway Bureau have the right of recourse against Hopewell group for compensation of 6.8 billion US dollars due to the loss of delayed construction. Thailand accused that Hopewell group only completed 12% of the originally scheduled project in past 8 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> After the economic crises of Thailand, Hopewell group had several negotiations with Thailand authorities without any result on worsened financial disputes due to devaluation of Baht and the disputes of land confiscation progress. Thailand government stopped the contract with Hopewell group in January this year. </seg>
<seg id=5> Therefore, Hopewell group asked Thailand government to compensate 100 billion Thailand Baht (about 4.2 billion Singapore dollars) for its capitals invested in the past 8 years and the partly completed project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Thailand government said yesterday that Thailand is planning to re-start this project with total investment of 3.2 billion US dollars, but considers reducing its scale. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Parady said, German government and Deutsch Reconstruction Bank(KFW)are interested in the renascence of this giant project, and decided to offer 100 million Thailand Baht for a feasibility study of Bangkok overhead railway and highway system project. </seg>
