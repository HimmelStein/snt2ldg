<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE WIRE Lisbon) Based on reliable reports, Jaime Gama, Portugal's foreign minister, met with a United Nations official in Vienna to discuss the report of an excessive number of Indonesian troops in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Gama's spokesperson Cesar said that the report conflicts with promises made both to Gama and United Nations general-secretary Kofi Annan by Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas in August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Cesar said Alatas had guaranteed to gradually reduce Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The information revealed that Gama will discuss relevant developments with Jamsheed Marker, Annan's special representative. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to reports spread by foreign journalists, what is clearly a confidential document of Indonesia military says that Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor numbered 17,834 at the end of July this year. </seg>
<seg id=7> The Western embassy said that this figure is close to what they had estimated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Nevertheless, Indonesian general Lingweilantuo said that the figure of 17 thousand is "a lie." </seg>
<seg id=9> He didn't reveal the actual figure, but an army official had once said that troops stationed in East Timor during August numbered about 11,500. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Indonesia sent its army to East Timor in 1975, and within their second year there had annexed East Timor. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> East Timor's leaders, including Nobel prize winner Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and imprisoned independence activist guerilla Gusimao, both released written statements supporting the report, refuting Jakarta's statement concerning the reduction of troops in East Timor. </seg>
