<seg id=1> Sheng Huaren, director of China's State Economic and Trade Commission, said that the Chinese military and other government departments will, in the near future, no longer have control of any companies. </seg>
<seg id=2> Even though in the past the Chinese government has given similar orders, the determination of the action seems greater than before. </seg>
<seg id=3> What follows is a written report from Voice of America's Ning Xin. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Sheng Huaren, director of China's State Economic and Trade Commission, said that by December 20 the Chinese military would no longer have any relations with subordinate companies. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other party, governmental and judicial departments will have to take similar action from the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Chairman Jiang Zemin issued an order in July of this year that the military and armed police forces stop doing business, including hotels and other commercial enterprises, in order to control increasingly widespread corruption and smuggling in internal departments in the military. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren said that up to now companies under the control of armies in Shanghai and Tianjin have already transferred control to local governments, but he didn't explain whether the army would be compensated. </seg>
<seg id=8> Along with the army, party, government and judicial departments also are not allowed to control companies. </seg>
<seg id=9> China's state-run enterprises have 100 million employees, but due to the problem of bad and dead accounts and weak exports brought about by the global economic crisis, many state-run enterprises are on the brink of bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said that many state-run enterprises have ten times more employees than they actually need, making last year's business losses even more serious. </seg>
<seg id=11> This illustrates that improving the state-run enterprises' competitiveness in the marketplace has become crucial. </seg>
<seg id=12> Analysts state that the universal corruption and bad management are universal in government and judicial departments administering state-run enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=13> The most common situation is that many government officials administering particular businesses are often operating other businesses in the same industry. </seg>
<seg id=14> They can then use their powers of office to give preferential treatment to these companies in terms of agreements, payments and taxes. </seg>
<seg id=15> This destroys fair competition in the marketplace, obstructing the transformation of China's planned economy into a free market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> According to reports, more than 500 of the largest state-run enterprises under the administration of party, government and judicial departments will fall under the supervision of a newly established commission under the State Council. Employees for these enterprises will be allocated by the human resources department. </seg>
<seg id=17> Slightly smaller enterprises will be managed by local governments. </seg>
<seg id=18> Other financial and investment companies will be managed by the department of finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> It is still not clear whether these changes mean the country will decrease payments to these state-run enterprises, which would lead some large companies to eventual bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts believe that owing to fears of social unrest brought about by high unemployment rates, China may want to use amalgamation instead of bankruptcy as a means of alleviating the losses in state-run enterprises. </seg>
