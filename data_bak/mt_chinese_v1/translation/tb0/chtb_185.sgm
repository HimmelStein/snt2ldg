</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> THIS NEWSPAPER'S WIRE Paris, Feb. 14, Lu Wangda reporting: France's foreign minister said that France will not agree to the redistribution of the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members nor the revision of the requirements with the U.N. charter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The minister made the statement at a meeting of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The foreign minister feels that the United Nations was born out of the second world war, and that France and the other permanent members of the council were victors in that war. </seg>
<seg id=5> Germany and Italy were defeated in the war, even though today they are democratic countries. But is it enough to take only a quick look back at past events in history? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> A report here said that being modern, economically powerful countries, people in Germany and Japan continually request that permanent member seats in the Security Council be redistributed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, said on the 11th that he hoped that with Germany's reunification the country could perform a larger function within the United Nations, and that the U.N. would give it more of a right to speak. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> France's foreign minister responded by saying that these views were impractical.  He said that permanent seats were appointed in the charter, and that to revise the charter would require the unanimous approval of member countries; France would not agree to revision of the charter. </seg>
