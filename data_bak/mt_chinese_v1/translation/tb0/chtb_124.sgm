<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Xiamen, Jan. 16 (Yu Yingrui reporting): Two convenience stores named "Beishun" opened for business here today. </seg>
<seg id=3> This marked the official startup of Xiamen's Fulan Puli Supermarkets Limited.  Sixty percent of the company's stock is owned by U.S. multinational Beatrice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Fulan Puli Supermarkets of Xiamen is a joint sino-foreign retail enterprise.  It's partners are Beatrice International of the U.S., Xiamen Foreign Suppliers Company, and Feili Huanqiu International Company of the Philippines. </seg>
<seg id=5> Their agreement states that the total investment in this project will be about 26 million U.S. dollars, of which 10 million will be invested in the first period. Twenty demonstration convenience stores and one modern distribution center will be opened in Xiamen at first; should the market develop, the total number of stores will reach 300 in nine different areas of the province. </seg>
<seg id=6> The stores will open mainly in densely populated areas. They will be approximately 400 square meters large, and will sell household necessities, along with staple and non-staple foods. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=8> China has been quite cautious about opening up its retail industry. Currently there are pilot projects only in Beijing, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Shanghai, in that order. Beatrice's development plan for its franchise stores in China counts as a big step for foreign-invested businesses in the country. </seg>
