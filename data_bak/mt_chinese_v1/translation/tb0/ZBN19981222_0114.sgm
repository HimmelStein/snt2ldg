<seg id=2> Malaysian correspondent Fei Nande reporting </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> Philippine officials believe that Malaysia is another country, along with China,  that is posing a potential threat to the Philippines in the Spratly Islands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A document from the Philippine military intelligence bureau shows that Malaysian forces had planned to occupy a Philippine reef. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The document says that Malaysia's planned action to occupy the Philippine reef might pose a security threat to the Philippines because the reef is geographically close to the Philippine island of Palawan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The document does not explain when this incident occurred, and does not explain why Malaysian forces never went ahead with the plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Philippine military officials, at an earlier meeting with reporters, said that Malaysia's plan to occupy the reef occurred in August, a few months before the Philippines' discovery in November of Chinese navy actions at Mischief Reef. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They explained that the Philippine authorities "convinced" Malaysia in time to stop them from carrying out their plan, but the Philippines defense official did not give details. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Before the Philippine military revealed Malaysia's plan to occupy the reef, President Estrada rejected its suggestion to control it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> In the same report, the military called China's structures at Mischief Reef a "springboard" to future occupation of the nearby Lide Reef where they would prepare to explore for oil. </seg>
