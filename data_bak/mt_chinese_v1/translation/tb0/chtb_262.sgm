<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY PRESS WIRE Nanjing, Sept. 1 (Yuan Yanghe reporting): Professor Liu Yuyi, the wildly popular painter known for his oil painting "Liang Xiao", recently unveiled a rainflower pebble named "Shenzhou In Five Ways Unique Stone" that he has discovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The stone's shape and size are the very image of the jade pendant worn for long life that is popular among the people. </seg>
<seg id=4> On the rainflower pebble itself is an extremely vivid image of the territory of the People's Republic of China. </seg>
<seg id=5> Both ends of the image ascend upward while the center slopes down. The bottom right part sticks out like a rooster protruding its chest out to cry.  At the side of the "rooster's" belly, next to a "straight", is the long and narrow island of Taiwan. Under the claws of the rooster is the round island of Hainan. </seg>
<seg id=6> The color of the two "islands" is completely the same as that of the "mainland". </seg>
<seg id=7> The whole image is the very picture of the map of China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Professor Liu Yuyi said that five years ago he found this rainflower pebble on the road in a rainflower pebble processing factory in a suburb of Nanjing. Taking it home, he looked it over in detail, and discover the "image of China" on it. </seg>
<seg id=9> At the same time, he also found that on the top of the image of the mainland was a giant dragon with a bright pearl in its mouth forcibly occupying the area along the border from northeast to northwest. Above the dragon, there is a golden yellow flare similar in shape to gold ingot. In the middle there are a string of torch-shaped stripes, symbolizing the indomitable spirit of the Chinese people. With the stone's similarity to a jade pendant worn for long life added to that, altogether there are five special meanings to it. </seg>
<seg id=10> This is why Liu Yuyi called the stone the "Shenzhou In Five Ways Unique Stone". </seg>
