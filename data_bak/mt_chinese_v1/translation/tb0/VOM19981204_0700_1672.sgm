<seg id=1> First let's have a look at Canada. </seg>
<seg id=2> Canada's minister for international trade, Sergio Marchi, said that when Canada exports products it should export its values as well in order to promote the improvement of human rights in China and other countries in Asia. </seg>
<seg id=3> Marchi was responding to the suggestion by the Canadian parliament's foreign affairs committee that trade should be linked to human rights. </seg>
<seg id=4> What follows is a report from Toronto by Voice of America's Yan Ming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Canada's minister of international trade, Sergio Marchi, responded in active agreement to a report coming out of the Senate's foreign relations committee in which it said that trade should be linked to human rights. </seg>
<seg id=6> Marchi said that Canada should make human rights a part of Canada's foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=7> It was reported in the Ottawa Citizen that Marchi talked about this at a conference on foreign relations and international trade in Ottawa on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id=8> Marchi said that he attended the summit meeting in Malaysia of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation not long ago, and the situation he saw there, along with the Chinese authorities' detention of dissenters of the past few days, made him firmly believe that Canada can export its values along with its products, whether that be economic assistance or dealing in international trade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Human rights and justice should become an important part of Canada's foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> The Canadian Press reported that a report made by the Canadian Senate's foreign relations committee suggested that the Canadian government should re-examine its foreign aid, and when giving aid to a country's economic development make every effort to promote the improvement of local human rights at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> A report in the National Post says there are indications that the Canadian government is trying to adjust its policy to Asian countries, including China;  the report by the Senate's foreign relations committee is but one example among many. </seg>
<seg id=12> On Thursday, Canadian foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy said that Canada's response to China's detention of a dissenter shows that it is extremely concerned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said, we need to make a response to this incident. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have already pointed out to the Chinese government that detaining someone with different political views is in violation of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed. </seg>
<seg id=15> The Canadian Press reported that during Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien's visit to China last month he publicly criticized China's record on human rights a couple of times, thereby changing the policy of the last two years of not publicly pointing out China's responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=16> Chretien's unusual tactic indicates some changes in Canada's foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> A report in the National Post said that Canadian businesspeople are not in full agreement in their support of international trade minister Marchi's linking of trade with human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> Some people privately worried that this would affect Canadian business. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, Zhu Yuzhao, a professor at British Columbia's Okanagan University College, has a very different view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> In terms of North American capital, they are investing in Asia, setting up factories, and doing trade, and an important reason for this is of course to make money. </seg>
<seg id=21> But while they're going into these Asian countries they can have standards such as labor protection. In terms of these labor protections, these standards for labor benefits, there are also environmental demands. Taking these standards into these countries is a bilateral thing. </seg>
<seg id=22> This kind, this kind of person who takes these standards into a country is an example, in terms of improving human rights at the local level, directly these labor rights, this kind of thing, it, it has a very direct kind of influence. </seg>
