</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE WIRE Hong Kong) Many people in Hong Kong are unwilling to call themselves Chinese even though Hong Kong rejoined China last year, a public opinion poll released yesterday shows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The results of the poll show that among 6.5 million residents of Hong Kong a total of 40 percent call themselves Hong Kongers, 22.3 percent of them say they are "Hong Kong Chinese", and 20.6 percent say they are "Chinese who live in Hong Kong." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The survey was carried out by the Social Sciences Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id=5> Only 20 percent of the 517 people polled called themselves Chinese, while 1.6 percent didn't answer clearly or didn't give any answer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> A half year after Hong Kong was returned to China a similar poll showed that 35.9 percent of the people in the city called themselves "Hong Kongers", while 18 percent used the term Chinese. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Hong Kong is now into the 15th month of its return to China. Hong Kong's government has made continued attempts to remind people there that they are Chinese. </seg>
<seg id=8> Hong Kong officials point to the 150 years under British colonial rule as the reason many Hong Kongers have difficulty identifying themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said two days ago on the national holiday that "I'm extremely proud to be Chinese, and I take great pride in the development of our country." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> To raise Chinese consciousness among Hong Kongers, the Hong Kong Association for the Advancement of Education wrote and published an excellent book of essays with pictures entitled "I am Chinese." </seg>
