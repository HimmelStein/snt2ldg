<seg id=1> Philippines Foreign Minister: No Hope Of Cambodia Joining ASEAN Next Month </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE WIRE Manila) Diamingo Siazon, Philippine foreign minister, said the day before yesterday that Cambodia has no hope of joining ASEAN during the leaders' summit being held in Hanoi next month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Siazon said that even if Cambodia's opposition groups form a united government before the talks the country won't automatically gain membership in ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "Many ASEAN member countries are hesitant. </seg>
<seg id=5> There are still many problems, Cambodia is still in the process of developing politically. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we accept them as a member country right now, when they starting fighting again in the future we'll just have to solve this problem again." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Earlier in the week Dato' Seri Abdullah HJ. Ahmad Badawi, Malaysian foreign minister, said the key to the issue of Cambodia joining ASEAN is whether it can establish a legal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "Some people say, weren't we already burned once before? At the time we were preparing to accept them, they started fighting again after only a few days," Siazon said. </seg>
<seg id=9> He was referring to what happened in April 1997 when Cambodia was about to join ASEAN. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> At the time Cambodia's hopes of joining ASEAN went up in smoke, mainly because Hun Sen used military force to overthrow Prince Ranariddh. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won the election in July of this year, but the party was unable to gain a two-thirds majority of seats needed to form a majority government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Hun Sen reached an agreement with Ranariddh to form a coalition government, but the new government has yet to be actually established. </seg>
