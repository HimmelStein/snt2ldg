<seg id=1> In Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, representatives attending the Global Climate Conference continued working. </seg>
<seg id=2> At the same time, the United States Congress is debating whether it should approve last year's protocol from the conference in Kyoto Japan. </seg>
<seg id=3> In another report filed by Voice of America reporter Fulaikuse from Buenos Aires, some American Congresspersons brought this debate to the conference floor in Buenos Aires on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id=4> What follows are the details of the report read by Ma Kairui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> United States Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman and Bob Kerrey issued statements in Buenos Aires on Tuesday urging the Clinton government to sign and approve the Kyoto Protocol this week. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two senators said that this would strengthen the position of American representatives in persuading developing countries to promise to reduce greenhouse gases. </seg>
<seg id=7> It is a fundamental condition that has actually been mentioned in a few previous Senate proposals. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some American congresspersons from the House of Representatives attending the conference in Buenos Aires said they oppose the Clinton government taking any sort of action like this. </seg>
<seg id=9> Wisconsin Republican representative Sensenbrenner, chairperson of the science group committee, said that the Kyoto Agreement is fatally flawed, and that it would definitely not be approved by the United States Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Sensenbrenner said, just as if the agreement has been shelved, the agreement was already dead when sent to the Senate, that the U.S. Senate would not approve this agreement. </seg>
<seg id=12> The problem is what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> Is it to save it, or to announce that this agreement has fatal flaws, and that discussion should be resumed. </seg>
<seg id=14> Representative Sensenbrenner said that this is not a question of a factional struggle between the two parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate, which a few famous Democrats have said as well. </seg>
<seg id=15> Pennsylvania Democrat Representative Senator Klink said that he opposed this agreement because it would cut employment opportunities, and would lower the level of America's industrialization. </seg>
<seg id=16> However, Ohio Democrat Representative Senator Kucinich didn't agree with Sensenbrenner's view, comparing global warming with the struggle for world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said the same determination would bring victory to the Kyoto Agreement. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> Senator Kucinich said, I hope this progress will continue, at the same time we shouldn't let the stubbornness of certain congresspersons take our eyes off of the certainty of reaching a global initiative, regardless of whether the United States Congress joins in or not. </seg>
<seg id=20> On the floor of the main meeting in Buenos Aires, the representatives discussed issues of every kind, among them some issues that will certainly be solved with the host country's energy and environment department leaders at Wednesday's meeting. </seg>
<seg id=21> The American representative said that even though some of the questions of concern to the American Congress would be postponed until next year's conference, this year's conference still made definite progress. </seg>
