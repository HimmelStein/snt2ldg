<seg id=1> Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda Goes To Japan For Rescue Loans Talks </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE WIRE Bangkok) Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, Thailand's finance minister, went to Tokyo yesterday to discuss Thailand's portion of the 30 billion U.S. dollars (48.6 billion Singapore dollars) in rescue loans allotted by Japan to Asian economies hit by the financial crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said that he will take part in thorough discussions during his four-day visit to Japan, but he has no way of predicting how much money Japan will give Thailand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Speaking to reporters at Bangkok International Airport, Nimmanahaeminda said, "I gave Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai an outline for the use of the money yesterday evening, but we still have decided upon the figures because Japan hasn't informed us of them yet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said he hoped they would obtain a low interest rate and generous payback terms from the plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He said he would have separate talks with officials from Japan's ministry of international trade and industry to discuss new aid in support of Thailand's industrial and agricultural regrouping. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's minister of finance, announced an aid package of 30 billion U.S. dollars at the Group of Seven conference on October 3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Within a short period, Japan will allocate 15 billion U.S. dollars in assistance in such areas as trade financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Japan will use the Export-Import Bank of Japan to provide direct financial aid in the form of payments and government loans, and will provide Asian countries with development aid in Japanese yen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> It will also guarantee bank payments to Asian countries and bonds issued by Asian countries, which will assist them in raising funds internationally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Kiichi Miyazawa's aid package is by no means insignificant, as just last month Thailand extended its issuance of global bonds valued at 500 million U.S. dollars. </seg>
<seg id=12> Thailand wants to take advantage of this money to inject even more capital into its economy. </seg>
<seg id=13> The economy suffered a deep blow both from expensive loan principles and the new storm in the global market. </seg>
