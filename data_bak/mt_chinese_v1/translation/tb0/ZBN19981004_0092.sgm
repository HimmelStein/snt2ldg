</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE WIRE Sydney) Taib Mahmud, chief minister of the Malaysian state of Sarawak, said that it is highly likely that former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim is guilty of all of the charges against him, including sodomy. Ibrahim has been arrested. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> During an interview with Australian newspapers yesterday he said that he was "quite familiar" with Anwar, and believed that it was extremely possible that Anwar could be convicted of the charges against him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "I know of the charges against him. </seg>
<seg id=5> I believe that the chances of him being convicted are fairly high." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> After being discharged from office at the beginning of September and initiating a series of reform demonstrations, Anwar was arrested and charged on September 20 with ten crimes under the Internal Security Act, including five charges of sodomy and five charges of corruption. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At his first public appearance on Tuesday, after being held for nine days by the police, he denied all of the charges in court. His left eye was slightly swollen and his arm was bruised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Taib Mahmud was attending a class reunion for international students in Adelaide. </seg>
<seg id=9> He said that he hasn't been in contact with Anwar recently, though he isn't worried about Anwar's situation, and doesn't fear that Anwar won't receive a fair trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> He said, "The law is fair ... if he is innocent, I believe he will be released. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, if the charges stand against him, he should be punished the same as other Malaysian citizens." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Taib also attributed Malaysia's tarnished image to Anwar. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said, "I believe that what's hurt our image isn't what happened here, but rather what Anwar has said." </seg>
