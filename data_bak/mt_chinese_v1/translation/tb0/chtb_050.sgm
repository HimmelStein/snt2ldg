<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Nanjing, Dec. 16 (Zhou Fang reporting): Foreign investment in Jiangsu's agricultural sector is on the increase. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Officials from the Jiangsu Province Agricultural and Forestry Bureau say that since 1994 more than 500 "Three Ventures" enterprises have been licensed using foreign investment totaling 700 million U.S. dollars.  This amounts to three times as many enterprises and seven times as much investment as in 1993. </seg>

<seg id=6> The speed of foreign investment is increasing so much that it's making up for any shortfalls the agricultural industry once had in Jiangsu, along with quickening the pace of development of the province's agricultural resources. </seg>
<seg id=7> The statistics show that there are currently more than 100 companies processing subsidiary agricultural products at an output value of more than 100 million Renminbi yuan. </seg>
<seg id=8> Lianyungang Ideal Group has used payments from the Japanese government and investment from foreign businesses to establish itself as China's largest and most varied exporter of processed vegetables. </seg>

These include malting barley, California bass, Luoshi marsh shrimp, quality-enhanced chicken, lean pork and vegetables, flowers and plants. Agricultural production has noticeably improved as well. </seg>
