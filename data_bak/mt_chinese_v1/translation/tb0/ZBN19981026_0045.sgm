</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE WIRE Detroit) The 107-year-old Hudson Building was reduced to rubble in 30 seconds the day before yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> The reinforced steel structure was 25 stories high, the tallest building ever to be demolished by implosion using plastic explosives placed at fixed points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Hudson Building was at one time the world's largest retail store, and was a landmark in Detroit. </seg>
<seg id=5> It was turned into 306 million kilograms of rubble by 1215 kilograms of plastic explosives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Local time was 5:45 pm. The Hudson Building underwent a series of internal explosions, and the thick dust became a huge fog, swallowing up the surrounding onlookers. </seg>
<seg id=7> A city resident said, "I never thought that the dust would cover my whole body in black." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> When the building collapsed some spectators cheered loudly, while others were in tears because they would never see this familiar building again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> During the 1950s, a period of great prosperity, some 100 thousand people shopped at the Hudson Building daily. </seg>
<seg id=10> At the time, movie stars such as Grable and Parker went shopping there as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Dennis Archer, Detroit mayor, publicly announced that the authorities were willing to give a member of the public the chance to set off the explosion if they would make a donation of 150 thousand U.S. dollars to charity. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, as the Hudson Building symbolized the glory of Detroit's better days, nobody was willing to set off the explosion and have a hand in destroying the building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> A man who had wanted to protect the building said, "This is a tragedy." </seg>
