<seg id=1> Lien Hoe Group To Buy Back 65 Percent Of Remaining Securities Before End of Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur) The Lien Hoe Group predicts that it will be able to use bank financing to redeem 65 percent of its remaining securities, valued at 53.81 million ringgit, before the end of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Lien Hoe's securities can be redeemed at an annual rate of 6 percent. The total value issued was 85.74 million Ringgit with the term limit until August 17, 1998. </seg>
<seg id=4> Due to real estate market devaluation and shrinking floating capital, Lien Hoe can only redeem 35 percent of the securities at the term deadline. The remaining 65 percent can be extended past the term limit to August 17, 2000 with an annual rate of 15 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Last month the Securities Trading Monitoring Commission approved Lien Hoe's extension of its securities term to August 17, 2000. The group is the first domestic company to obtain this extension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Based on current drops in interest rates in the market, Lien Hoe plans to get bank financing to redeem the remaining securities. It won't have to pay the 15 percent annual rate to holders of its securities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Zeng Hualong, the company's managing director, said due to current interest rates being lower new financial budgets are beneficial to the development of real estate. He predicted that Lien Hoe will turn around from the inferior position of the first half of the year and show a good performance for the remainder of the year. </seg>
