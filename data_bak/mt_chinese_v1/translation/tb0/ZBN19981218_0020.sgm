<seg id=1> Huang Sihua: Build Favorable Climate Next Year, Malaysia To Retain 10 Billion In Foreign Investment In Stock Market </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Kuala Lumpur) Huang Sihua, deputy finance minister for Malaysia, said that by September 1 there will have been one year of controls on foreign exchange. He predicts that there will be more than 10 billion ringgit in foreign funds that can be withdrawn from the stock market, and because of this the government will employ many different measures to create a favorable investment climate in order to encourage foreign investment to remain in Malaysia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said that in terms of third-quarter growth, Malaysia's economy is looking like it's recovering, and believes that in September of next year the economy will be stable. Market activity is brisk, and foreign businesses are deciding to engage in investment activity in Malaysia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Huang Sihua spoke two days ago at a economic report and exchange meeting held by the Malaysian Chinese United Industry and Commerce Association. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He stressed that the Malaysian government would hold the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the U.S. dollar in order to encourage investors to make long-term investment plans, to make even more precise investment decisions, and to no longer be worried about currency fluctuations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He said control measures will continue for a while longer until international currency markets stabilize. The international community has set up a system that controls speculation and has established transparency in the currency trade; this well-run operation will avoid financial storms from occurring again in southeast Asia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Huang Sihua also said that the country, with the finance department's agreement,  has approved 20 percent of the companies who complained that they originally had not been approved for financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said that the finance department will continue to provide consulting or other relevant assistance to companies who don't qualify for financing in order to allow those who wish to develop companies to do their planning smoothly. This will energize domestic economic market activity, he said. </seg>
