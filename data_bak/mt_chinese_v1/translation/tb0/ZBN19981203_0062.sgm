<seg id=1> Believing Themselves Discriminated Against By Locals, Thousands of English Immigrants Are Leaving Australia </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AGENCE FRANCE PRESS WIRE Sydney) Investigations released yesterday show that a combination of an "English are the enemy attitude" and discrimination by the locals has resulted in thousands of English immigrants deciding to leave Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> For the benefit of the immigrants and for Australia's economy, the English Immigrant Association has appealed to the government to correct this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Association chairperson Hunter said that English people believe that Australians have an "English are the enemy attitude", and that the Australian economy "may lose millions of dollars because of it." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said that the fact that so many English are choosing to leave Australia is really disappointing because the people who are leaving are mostly economically independent skilled tradespeople. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> He told this reporter, "Based on the immigration regulations here, these immigrants are the kind you don't want to lose." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> English people account for 14 percent of Australia's immigrants. </seg>
<seg id=8> Nevertheless, statistics from the Department of Immigration show that from 1996 to 1997 while 11,978 people immigrated from England to Australia, 3,737 people left during the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Hunter said the association did an independent study in Melbourne and discovered that one-quarter of the English people in Australia believe that they are victims of discrimination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Nearly 40 percent of those queried believe that that the locals show disfavor toward the English. </seg>
<seg id=11> A total of 37 percent said that complaints made by English immigrants do not receive the same conscientious treatment that those of other ethnic groups do. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> About 35 percent of those questioned blame the media for making the locals feel that the English are criminals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Hunter said the anti-English stance of Australia's former prime minister, Keating, was no help. </seg>
