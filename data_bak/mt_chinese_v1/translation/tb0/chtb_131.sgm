</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Abidjan, Jan. 18 (Linghu Daocheng reporting): Niamien N'Goran, minister of economy and finance for the Ivory Coast, said here today that the economy of each member state of West Africa's Economic and Currency League was going to see significant renewed growth, and that the major components of their economies were showing a positive situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> N'Goran, at a forum held by the France-Ivory Coast Businessperson's Club, said that the average annual economic growth rate for 1996 for each member state of West Africa's Economic and Currency League went back up to 5.9 percent, and for 1997 it was 6.3 percent. In 1994 it was only 2.6 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that in the last few years West African countries have been putting great effort into improving imbalances in imports and exports, along with enhancing the public investment situation. The trade surplus has increased quite a lot as well. At the same time, budget deficits have decreased remarkably, only taking up 1.3 percent of the domestic production output of each country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> When talk turned to how Europe's impending switch to a single currency would affect the African franc, N'Goran said that people shouldn't worry about the African franc's future. </seg>
<seg id=6> He said that due to the return to growth of each country in West Africa's Economic and Currency League, it would be impossible for the African franc to fall 50 percent in value in a short period, as it did in January of 1994. </seg>
