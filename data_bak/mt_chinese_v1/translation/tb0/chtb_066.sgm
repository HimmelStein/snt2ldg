<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Xining, Dec. 21: Urban infrastructure that had in the past hindered foreign investment is now being looked upon favorably by foreign companies, and has joined Qinghai's development of natural resources as a drawing factor for foreign investment in the province. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Xining City's long term investment in urban infrastructure had been insufficient. From the founding of the People's Republic up to 1995 the total investment for those forty-six years had been only about 400 million yuan, a lag in urban development that had slowed down economic development. </seg>
<seg id=4> In the past two years a number of foreign investors have expressed the desire to step into Xining's urban development sphere. </seg>
<seg id=5> In light of general trends in this area, the Qinghai provincial government, pointing to the commodification of urban development, passed a regulation at the beginning of this year called "Several Regulations Concerning Xining City's Encouragement of Foreign Investment". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Once Xining City decided to transfer power of operation for the road leading out of the city to the east, over ten foreign companies showed up for talks. In the end a 50 million yuan bid price was fixed. </seg>
<seg id=7> In accordance with the requirements for modernization of the city, work on the old city's Mojia Street will by undertaken by a Hong Kong company which has invested 50 million yuan in the project. </seg>
<seg id=8> The construction of the Sixth Waterworks used almost 20 million yuan in foreign investment.  Able to reach an output of 150,000 tons of water per day, it will greatly relieve Xining's water supply stress-nervousness. </seg>
<seg id=9> The city has already reached an agreement with the Taihua Company of Hong Kong for the construction of the road leading out of the city to the north, which will require an investment of about 180 million yuan.  A number of foreign companies have come here for talks concerning the construction of a southern ring road as well. </seg>
