<seg id=1> We know that the climatic results produced by El Nino last year include Indonesia's continuing fires, flooding in Peru's desert region, as well as serious, widespread climate irregularities around the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the United States at the beginning of this year there was much flooding in California and in the southern states, and then in the south there was a drought. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to experts, right now El Nino is transforming itself into a new phenomenon, called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> Next year La Nina will appear in a manner much more shocking than El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> What follows is a report from Chicago by Voice of America's Li Lan, read by Ji Zhifeng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In Chicago winters are usually extremely cold, but last year was a lot warmer than usual, and there was less snowfall than usual as well. Next winter probably won't be much different. </seg>
<seg id=7> At the same time El Nino wreaked havoc in Southeast Asia, lowering rainfall amounts by a lot. Droughts caused out-of-control wildfires lasting for weeks. </seg>
<seg id=8> El Nino and La Nina are the result of large changes in the surface temperature of the tropical eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino means that the surface temperature of the water is a lot higher than normal, affecting air current movement and then producing climatic changes all over the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nina means that the surface temperature of the water is a lot lower than normal, so that its affect on regional climates is the opposite of that of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=11> Climate expert Lafa, of the United States Weather Bureau, says that next year Indonesia's large fires may not get out of control because rainfall between December of this year and March of next year should be higher than usual. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time, western and southeastern Africa will have slightly lower temperatures than normal, while northern South America will see more rainfall. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern half of the United States will be dryer than in the past, meaning that Texas and New Mexico may continue to experience drought, while Florida will have a higher than normal chance of forest fires. </seg>
<seg id=14> This year heavy rains in California and southern regions can be attributed to the effects of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=15> Lafa says that El Nino doesn't produce rainstorms, but does provide the conditions for serious rainstorms to take shape. </seg>
<seg id=16> The summer in the United States this year has been one of the hottest on record. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some people link the El Nino effect to rising of global temperatures. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lafa believes that this is a possibility, but at present there still isn't any proof. </seg>
<seg id=19> However, no matter whether the other elements exist or not, the north and midwest regions of the United States are going to have a colder winter with much more snow than normal. </seg>
