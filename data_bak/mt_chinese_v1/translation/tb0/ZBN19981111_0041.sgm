</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (REUTERS WIRE Washington) Alice Rivlin, United States Federal Reserve Board vice chairperson, warned on Monday that the global financial storm will lead to a large-scale slowing down of the American economy, and hints that the United States may need to go further in reducing interest rates to avoid an economic downturn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In an interview, Rivlin said she believed the American economy would not go into a slump, but warned that exports have gone down and employment opportunities have decreased, meaning that the economy will go into a large-scale economic downturn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice in the last six weeks in order to avoid the American economy from being affected by the worst economic storm in half a century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Federal Reserve will hold a meeting on November 17 to discuss the issue of cutting interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=6> The general feeling is that the Reserve will cut rates in order to maintain economic stability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The American economy grew by only 3.3 percent in the third quarter, 5.5 percent less than the first quarter. </seg>
<seg id=8> The general prediction is that the American economy will slow down in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id=9> This is due to the fact that American exports to Asia have decreased, affecting investment and production in the manufacturing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Rivlin pointed out that the extreme pressure that the American financial markets have been under has calmed a bit in the last few weeks. </seg>
<seg id=11> Nevertheless, she warned that the credit crunch still exists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
