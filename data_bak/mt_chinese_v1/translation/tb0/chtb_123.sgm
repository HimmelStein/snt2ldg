<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Beijing, Jan. 26 (Xu Xingtang and Qian Yuhong reporting): Dai Xianglong, president of the People's Bank of China, said that China will continue with its policy of opening up to the outside world in the area of finance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> During today's press conference for the Chinese and foreign media, he stressed that the financial upheaval in some southeast Asian countries will affect China's policy of opening up financially to the outside world. </seg>
