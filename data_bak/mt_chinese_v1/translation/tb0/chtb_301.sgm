<p>
<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Paris, Sept. 1 (Zhang Youhao reporting): Francois Leotard, the French minister of state for defense, said today that France is studying a plan for a military pull-out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Leotard said this during a radio interview in Paris. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said that the United States recommendation to lift the weapons embargo on Bosnia would mean that "international aid may end", that "a very large public conflict will erupt again", and that it will "result in creating huge losses." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Leotard said "with no guarantee for the safety of the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force, we can't accept the lifting of the weapons embargo on Bosnia." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Alain Juppe, foreign minister for France, clearly stated last week that for lifting the embargo, "the first condition is that France move out its Blue Beret Unit along with all United Nations peace-keeping forces." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> France has continually had about four thousand troops posted in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the eruption of the conflict February 1992. </seg>
<seg id=8> It has posted the most troops of any Western nation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> United States president Bill Clinton announced on August 10 that if the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the five-country peace initiative by October 15, he would then request that the Security Council pass a resolution canceling the weapons embargo against Bosnia. If the Security Council can't pass such a resolution, he would seek to have the United States lift its own weapons embargo against Bosnia. </seg>
