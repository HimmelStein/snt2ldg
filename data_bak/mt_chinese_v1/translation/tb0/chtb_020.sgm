<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Taiyuan, Feb. 7 (Shan Baohong reporting with intern journalist Hu Jingguo):  Fengling Economic Development Zone, located along the borders of China's Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan provinces in what is known as the Yellow River's "Golden Delta", is increasingly gaining the attention of both foreign and Chinese business people. It has become a new hot spot for investment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Fengling, China's only economic development zone established by a small city,  is Shanxi's new conduit to the outside world. Shanxi is a land-locked province. </seg>
<seg id=4> Three years in the making, the development zone is beginning to take shape, with wood, herbal medicines, tobacco, clothing, grain oil and other industrial products  passing through its comprehensive wholesale marketplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The development zone, now crowded with buildings and businesses, is a modern, multi-functional commercial city enjoying 60 million yuan in investment.  Nearing the end of the establishment of new towns in the Golden Delta, 2,000 computerized telephones are in use and 10,000 high-tension circuits are in normal operation. This is attracting a large number of investors. Factories producing citric acid, perfume and specialized oil-based paints are among the thirty or more that are sending products all over China's interior. An orthopedic, a gynecological, and a pediatric hospital, all new and with the most advanced equipment available, are now open as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The swift rise of the Golden Delta has caught the eye of business people outside of China. Currently, more than fifty financial and business groups from countries and territories such as the U.S., France, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are involved in talks here concerning 31 projects worth up to 320 million yuan. </seg>
