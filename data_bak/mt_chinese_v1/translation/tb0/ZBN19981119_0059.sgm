<seg id=2> (AMERICAN PRESS WIRE Lisbon) The office of the procurator-general in Portugal said that the procurator-general is studying the demand by a Portuguese member of parliament that former Indonesian president Suharto be extradited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Member of Parliament Nuno Correia da Silva's letter says that Suharto should answer for human rights violations in East Timor and be extradited. </seg>
<seg id=4> In 1975 Indonesia invaded East Timor, the former Portuguese colony, and after several weeks annexed East Timor to Indonesian territory. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Pinochet is currently in London, waiting for a decision from the higher courts on his extradition. </seg>
<seg id=9> England's High Court revoked the detention of Pinochet at the very beginning due to Pinochet's immunity from prosecution as the former leader of a country. </seg>

<seg id=10> Da Silva is a member of Portugal's right wing Popular Party. </seg>
<seg id=11> He said that the United Nations still believes Portugal is East Timor's legal administrator, which will assist them in their demand for the extradition of Suharto. </seg>
