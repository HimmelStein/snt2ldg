<seg id=1> An arms control representative group in Beijing to discuss the issue of China's admittance to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) believes that China may still be exporting guided missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> What follows is a comprehensive report by Voice of America' Fang Yuan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A group of officials led by United States Department of State senior advisor John Holum held one and a half days of talks in Beijing with Chinese foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese army deputy chief of staff Xiong Guangkai, and other Chinese arms control experts concerning China's admittance into the MTCR. </seg>
<seg id=4> The talks center on how to implement Chinese chairman Jiang Zemin's ideas made during President Clinton's visit to China this July. </seg>
<seg id=5> Jiang Zemin said that the fact that China is considering joining the MTCR is a major achievement of the U.S.-China leadership talks. </seg>
<seg id=6> A member of the American representative group, speaking to the Associated Press, said that the United States has concerns about whether or not China is still exporting guided missile components or technology, and that Pakistan and Iran are two countries that benefit from China's exportation of guided missile technology. </seg>
<seg id=7> The official said that the United States continually brings up this issue with China, and he believes China is adopting measures to resolve this problem. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's exportation of guided missile technology has always been a source of friction in U.S.-China relations. </seg>
<seg id=9> Since the first half of this year, long-time enemies Asian subcontinental India and Pakistan have both continued nuclear testing. The United States has been feeling it especially needs China to make a promise to yield to the guided missile technology controls because in the nuclear competition the Asian subcontinent Pakistan is China's long-term ally. </seg>
<seg id=10> Already in 1993 the United States activated economic sanctions against China for selling guided missile components and technology to Pakistan, up until China guaranteed to stop exporting surface-to-surface guided missiles. The United States lifted the sanctions against China in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=11> The United States is also worried that China's exchange of guided missiles with Iran will be a serious threat to American allies and interests in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=12> Nevertheless, the American official who related the above information was unwilling to explain in more detail what kind of missile technology China provided to Pakistan and Iran nor when they provided it. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said there still wasn't enough evidence to ascertain what technology China has actually exported to the two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> Whenever the United States obtained evidence of China exporting guided missile technology to the two countries in the past, China either denied it or said it was so-called "dual-use technology", that the technology it exported was used for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id=15> China has yet to make a public reaction to the statements made by the official from the American representative group. </seg>
<seg id=16> In other news, according to an Associated Press report from Beijing, Washington has determined that the country helping Pakistan develop and, as of April of this year, launch "Gaoli" guided missiles, was not China but North Korea. </seg>
