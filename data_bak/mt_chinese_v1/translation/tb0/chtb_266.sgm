<seg id=1> World Bank To Provide 250 Million U.S. Dollars In Aid To Palestine </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Jerusalem, August 31 (Huai Chengbo reporting): Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry, was quoted in today's Jerusalem Post as saying that the World Bank has decided to give 250 million U.S. dollars in aid to Palestine's self-governing body before the end of 1994. Savir is currently on a trip to the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This decision breaks an almost yearlong impasse between donor nations and the Palestine self-governing authority. </seg>
<seg id=4> An international conference on aiding Palestine's self-government took place in Washington last year on October 1. Donor countries promised to give 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in development aid within five years, the first year giving 750 million dollars. </seg>
<seg id=5> However, the donor countries said that the self-governed area in Palestine was lacking the necessary mechanism and accounts to process the money, and so refused to completely fulfill this promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Savir said even though the United States and the World Bank aren't completely satisfied with Palestine's accounting work at present, they still agreed to pay a portion of the aid immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, along with other Palestinian leaders, have consistently criticized donor countries for not being able to fulfill promises to have the aid money completely in place on time. </seg>
<seg id=8> Nabil Shaath and Danny Rothschild, chief negotiators for Palestine and Israel respectively, came to Washington to discuss the issue of aid payments with both the United States and the World Bank. </seg>
