<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE New York, March 6 (Zhou Xisheng reporting): At a luncheon meeting held by the National Committee on United States-China Relations in New York today, James Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, appealed to the U.S. to "have a strategic vision in adopting a continually credible and constructive policy toward China", along with a candid and honest dialogue to resolve differences on various issues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Sasser said that the U.S. should squarely face China's abrupt rise on the international stage. China's stable, healthy development, both at the end of this century and into the next, should be seen as a big opportunity for foreign policy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When speaking of the issues of human and intellectual property rights in China, the ambassador said that China has already made progress in leaps and bounds. </seg>
<seg id=5> He believes that the freedom and democracy that the Chinese people enjoy right now are incomparable with the situation in the past, and that the U.S should not be indifferent to the cooperative attitude China has adopted toward the issue of intellectual property rights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Sasser asserted further that once China has joined the World Trade Organization the U.S. Congress should cancel its annual talks on the issue of China's most-favored-nation trade status, and instead give China permanent most-favored-nation status. </seg>
<seg id=7> He said that the U.S. Congress's annual discussion on this issue will only hurt the U.S. itself, affecting the confidence of American business people investing in China and thus affecting job opportunities for Americans. </seg>
