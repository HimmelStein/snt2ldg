<p>
<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Beijing, Feb. 12: The economic development of China's fourteen open border cities, begun in 1995, has seen gratifying achievements. </seg>
<seg id=3> Statistics show that these cities had a total domestic production value of over 19 billion yuan last year. This was an increase of more than 90 percent over 1991, the year before the cities were opened up to development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In 1992 the state council consecutively sanctioned the opening up of Heihe, Pingxiang, Hunchun, Yining, Ruili and other border cities, along with authorizing them to establish their own economic cooperation zones. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the past three years or more, the societies and economies of these cities have developed rapidly, and the local economies have seen a noticeable improvement as well. Average growth per fiscal year was 17 percent, which was higher than the national average. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to reports, both urban development and the cooperation zones in these fourteen cities are growing faster and faster. </seg>
<seg id=7> The accumulative investment in fixed assets totals 12 billion yuan for the past three years. In former days it was said that "buildings weren't tall, roads weren't flat, lights didn't work, water wasn't clear and information didn't flow smoothly"; this is no longer true. </seg>
<seg id=8> The economic cooperation zones have already developed 22.6 square kilometers, attracting 287 "Three Ventures" enterprises with foreign investment totalling  890 million U.S. dollars. </seg>
<seg id=9> There are also 5100 "inland-associated" enterprises, of which 175 have already begun operations. </seg>
