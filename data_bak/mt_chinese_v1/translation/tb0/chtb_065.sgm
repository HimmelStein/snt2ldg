<seg id=2> XINHUA NEWS AGENCY WIRE Shanghai, Dec. 21 (Wu Yu reporting with correspondent Pu Hai): According to statistics put out by Pudong Customs in Shanghai, the value of imports and exports in Pudong's New District (including the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone) has reached 8.579 billion U.S. dollars up to November of this year, a nearly one-quarter increase over the same period last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> The estimate for the whole year is 9 billion dollars. </seg>

<seg id=4> Foreign trade in Pudong's New District saw a balance between imports and exports as a strong factor in its growth. </seg>
<seg id=5> Trade in raw materials processing has developed quickly, with more than two hundred state-owned enterprises now working in the processing industry in the district.

Operations are gradually evolving from simple materials processing to comprehensive processing of high tech, high value-added products. </seg>
