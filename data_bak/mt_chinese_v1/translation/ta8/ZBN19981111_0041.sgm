<seg id=1> The U.S. Federal Reserve Bureau Might Reduce the Interest Rate Again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Reuters. Washington) Vice-chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bureau Reevlin warned on Monday that the global economic crisis might lead to a large-scale slowdown in the U.S. economy, and he suggested that America might need to further reduce the interest rate to avoid the economic decline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Reevlin in the interview said that she thought American economy would not collapse, but she warned that the drop in export and the decrease of employment opportunities indicated that the economy would slow down in a large scale. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The Federal Reserve Bureau has reduced the interest rate twice during the last 6 weeks, in order to avoid that the American economy would be affected by the most serious economic crisis in this half of the century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Federal Reserve Bureau will have a meeting on 17th, November, discussing the issue of reducing the interest rate. </seg>
<seg id=6> As generally conjectured, the Bureau will decide to reduce the interest rate once again, in order to retain the steady economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The American economy in the third quarter only increased by 3.3%, 5.5% lower than the first quarter. </seg>
<seg id=8> As generally predicted, in the following months, the economic growth will slow down further. </seg>
<seg id=9> This is because that the decrease of America's export to Asia has led to the situation that the investment and the output of the American manufacturing industry are influenced by this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Reevlin pointed out that the great pressure which the American financial market endured has been slightly lightened during the recent weeks. </seg>
<seg id=11> But, she warned that credit inflation still existed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Reevlin thought that the world economy has not freed itself totally from the crisis yet. </seg>
<seg id=13> The recovery of Asia is still at the beginning stage. </seg>
<seg id=14> Japan, the world's second largest economic body hasn't recovered yet and the economic situation in Rusia is still "very bad". </seg>
