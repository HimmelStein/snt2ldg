<seg id=1> Now let's have a look at Canada first. </seg>
<seg id=2> As Canada's International Trade Minister Marge indicated, Canada should also export her values while she is exporting her trade products, in order to improve the situation of human rights in China and other Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id=3> Marge made this comment in response to the proposal made by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Canadian Congress that trade should be linked with the issue of human rights. </seg>
<seg id=4> Now listen to the report by VOA reporter Yan Ming from Toronto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Canada's International Trade Minister Marge gave a very active response to the proposal in a report by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Canadian Senate that trade should be linked with the issue of human rights. </seg>
<seg id=6> Marge stated that Canada should list the issue of human rights as a new factor in its foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=7> According to a report in Ottawa Citizen Newspaper, Canada's Federal International Trade Minister Marge made the statement when he was attending a meeting on foreign affairs and international trade in Ottawa on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id=8> As Marge indicated, what he saw at the spot of the summit meeting of APEC that he attended in Malasia as well as the situation of the arrest of the dissidents by the Chinese authorities in the recent days convinced him that Canada, in providing econimic aid or doing international trade, should export its values while exporting its products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Human rights and social justice should be taken as an important element in Canada's foreign trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=10> According to a report from Canada News Agency, a report by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Canadian Senate proposes that the Canadian government should re-examine the various items of aid to foreign countries and should try to help improve the situation of human rights in those countries when providing economic assistance there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to the report of State Post, there is every sign that the Canadian government is trying to adjust her policy toward Asian countries including China, and the report by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Canadian Senate is just one of the signals. </seg>
<seg id=12> Canada's Foreign Minister Axiworse indicated on Thursday that Canada is greatly concerned about the action of arresting the dissidents in China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> He said, we must give a response to this incident. </seg>
<seg id=14> We have pointed out to the Chinese government that the action of arresting dissidents is a violation of the international treaty of United Nations citizen right and political right signed by China. </seg>
<seg id=15> According to a report from Canada News Agency, during his visit to China last month Canadian Prime Minister Redion did criticize China's human rights record on several public occasions, thus changing his way of evading criticizing China publicly for the past two years and more. </seg>
<seg id=16> This unusual action taken by Canadian Prime Minister actually indicates a certain change in Canada's foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=17> According to the report of State Post, Canada's business circles have different responses to the International Trade Minister Marge's attitude of standing up for the link between trade and human rights. </seg>
<seg id=18> Some people worry in private that this would undermine the business of Cnandian enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=19> But Dr. Zhu Yuchao of Oaknegan University of British Columbia of Canada holds a very different view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=20> For the capitalists of North America, the affection is rather severe, because they come around to East Asia to invest, to build factories, and to trade; one important reason for them to do so is for making money, and they must make a profit. </seg>
<seg id=21> But when they enter into these East Asian countries, they can bring with them some criteria, such as labor protection; ah, the labor protection, the labor welfare, and the environment requirement, all thses criteria can be brought to those countries, and this is bilateral. </seg>
<seg id=22> Also, this man that is brought there is exemplary, and this will help improve the situation of human rights there, and things like the labor right will have a direct effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=23> The above is the report by the special reporter Yan Ming from Toronto. </seg>
