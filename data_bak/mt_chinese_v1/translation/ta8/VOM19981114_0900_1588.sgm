<seg id=1> In respect of meteorology, we know that El Nino's consequences include the incessant big fire in Indonesia, the flood in the desert in Peru, and the very abnormal climate in many parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id=2> Flood invaded California and several states in the south of USA this year, and it was followed up by drought in many areas of the south. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to the expert, El Nino phenomenon is now changed into a new one, which is called La Nina. </seg>
<seg id=4> Moreover, La Nina will have a surprising performance next year not inferior to El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=5> Now listen to the report by VOA reporter Li Lan from Chicago, spoken by Chi Zhifeng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In Chicago where it was always severely cold in winter, it was much warmer last year than before, and the snowfall was much smaller; the next winter is expected to be much the same. </seg>
<seg id=7> At the same time, El Nino was wreaking havock in Southeast Asia, so that the rainfall there diminshed greatly and the wild fire caused by draught was out of control for several weeks. </seg>
<seg id=8> Both El Nino and La Nino are the result of dramatic change of surface water temperature in the tropical east Pacific Ocean. </seg>
<seg id=9> El Nino means that the surface water temperature is much higher than usual, which affects the move of the atmosphere and consequently changes the climate in various parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id=10> La Nino means that the surface water temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean is much lower than the norm, and its effect on climate in many areas is just the opposite to that of El Nino. </seg>
<seg id=11> Lafu, the climate expert of the US State Meteorological Agency, said that the big fire in Indonesia may not be out of control next year, because the rainfall from December this year to March next year in this area is expected to be more than last year. </seg>
<seg id=12> At the same time, the temperature in West Africa and Southeast Africa will be a bit lower than usual, and the rainfall in the north of South America will be more. </seg>
<seg id=13> The southern half of the US will be dryer than usual, which means that there may be continuous drought in Texas and New Mexico while the chance of forest conflagration in Florida is higher than usual. </seg>
<seg id=14> El Nino is to blame for the torrential rain in California and other southern areas this year. </seg>
<seg id=15> Lafu said that El Nino will not produce tempests, but it will provide conditions for the formation of severe tempests. </seg>
<seg id=16> The summer in US this year is one of the hottest in history. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some people connect global warming with El Nino phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id=18> Lafu thinks that this association is reasonable but it has not been proved so far. </seg>
<seg id=19> But for whatever reason, the coming winter in the north and midwest parts of the US will be a  colder and more snowy one than last year. </seg>
