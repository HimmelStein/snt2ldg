<seg id=1> Philipine Foreign Miniser: Cambodia Has No Hope of Joining ASA (Asian Safety Association) </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP, Manila) Philippine Foreign Minister Si Ason said yesterday that when ASA leaders hold the summit meeeting in Hanoi next month, Cambodia will have no hope of joining ASA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Si Ason said that even if the Cambodian opponents form a united government during the summit meeting, it will not become the ASA member country automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "many ASA member countries are hesitating. </seg>
<seg id=5> At present, there are still many problems, the Cambodian political progress is still under way. </seg>
<seg id=6> If we don't accept them as a new member country, then when they fight with each other again in the future, we have to settle this problem again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Early this week, Malaysian Foreign Minister Adula said that the problem concerning Cambodia's joining ASA would depend on whether it can establish a legitimate goverment or not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Si Ason said, "someone once said, weren't we burned last time? We were ready to accept them then, but after several days, they fought with each other again. " </seg>
<seg id=9> He evidently meant the event in March of 1997 when Cambodia was about to join ASA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> At that time, the reason why Cambodia's hope of join ASA vanished like soap bubbles was that Honson overthrew Prince Lanari by force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Honson's Cambodian People's Party won the election in July of this year, but the party couldn't get two-thirds of the majority seats needed for the sole reign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Last week, Honson had reached an agreement with Lanari on forming a united government, but the new government hasn't been really established yet. </seg>
