<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 6. (Reporter Zhou Xisheng) On 6, Joseph W. Prueher, the U.S. Ambassador to China, made a speech in New York at the luncheon party held by the State Commission of U.S. China Relations, calling on the United States to take, "with a strategic foresight, a continuous, reliable and constructive China policy", and to solve, with frank and all-round dialogues, the divergence with China on some issues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Prueher pointed out that the United States ought to correctly face China's rise on international arena. The United States, not only at the end of this century but in the next century, ought to see it as a great opportunity in its foreign policy to develop stable and healthy relations with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When talking about the problem of human rights and of intellectual property protection, the Ambassador pointed out that China has made considerable progress in these two aspects. </seg>
<seg id=5> He thought that the freedom and democracy the Chinese people are enjoying now are incomparable to the past, and also China has taken an active and cooperative attitude on the aspect of intellectual property protection, which the United States should not turn a blind eye to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Prueher still advocated that, after China joins WTO, the Congress of the United States should call off the yearly discussion over the question of China's most-favored-nation trade treatment. </seg>
<seg id=7> He pointed out that the U.S. Congress' yearly debate over the question, in reality, does no good to the U.S., affecting U.S. merchants' confidence in investing in China and, consequently, affecting job opportunities of the Americans. </seg>
