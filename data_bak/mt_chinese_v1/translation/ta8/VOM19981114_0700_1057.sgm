<seg id=1> A US arms control delegation that is going to Beijing to negotiate with China about her earlier accession to the missile techonlogy control treaty thinks that China may still be exporting missile technology to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=2> Now listen to the news roundup by VOA reporter Fang Yuan. </seg>

<seg id=3> A group of US officials led by the deputy Secretary of State of the US State Department Holem had a talk for one and a half days with the deputy chief of the general staff of Chinese Army Xiong Guangkai and other Chinese experts of arm control on the issue of China's accession to the missile control treaty. </seg>
<seg id=4> The talk focused on how to realize the expression given by Chinese Chairman Jiang Zemin during President Clinton's visit to China this June. </seg>
<seg id=5> At the time, Jiang Zemin indicated that China would consider her accession to the missile technology control treaty, which had been considered to be one of the major achievements in the summit meeting between US and China. </seg>
<seg id=6> A member of the US delegation indicated to the US Associated Press that it is still doubtful whether China is still exporting the missile parts or missile technology, and that Pakistan and Iran are the two beneficiaries of China's exportation of missile technology. </seg>
<seg id=7> This official said that the US would continue to raise this question to China, and he believed that China is also taking measures to resolve these issues. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's exportation of missile technology has always been an issue that is likely to cause friction between US and China. </seg>
<seg id=9> Ever since the nuclear experiments consecutively made before July this year by India and Pakistan, the two old enemies in the subcontinent of South Asia, the US has felt a special need for China to make a promise on the issue of missile technology control and transference, because Pakistan, a rival in the nuclear arms race in South Asia subcontinent, is a long-standing ally with China. </seg>
<seg id=10> Earlier in 1993, the US took economic sanctions against China because China sold missile parts and technology to Pakistan; not until China promised to stop exporting land-to-land missiles did the US lift the sanctions against China in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=11> The US also worries that the missile trade between China and Iran would pose a serious threat to the interests of the US and her allies in the middle East. </seg>
<seg id=12> However, the US official that revealed the above news was unwilling to detail what kinds of missile technology China had provided to Pakistan and Iran and when she did that. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said that there was still no adequate evidence to prove that China did export the missile technology to these two countries. </seg>
<seg id=14> In the past, whenever the US obtained the evidence that China exported the missile technology to these two countries, China would either deny it or state that the technology is so-called two-edged and that its exportation is for a peaceful purpose. </seg>
<seg id=15> So far, China has not given any response to the saying of the US delegation officials in public. </seg>
<seg id=16> Also, according to a report by the US Associated Press from Beijing, Washington has confirmed that the country that helped Pakistan develop and launch the Korean missiles this April is North Korea rather than China. </seg>
