</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP, Sydney) Taiyimamu, chief minister of Shalaoyue State of Malasia said, Malysian former deputy Prime Minister Anwar in detention is most likely to have committed all the crimes charged against him, including the charge of sodomy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> He said in an interview with an Australian newspaper journalist yesterday that he was "fairly familiar with" Anwar, and believed that chances are Anwar would be found guilty under all the charges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said, "I have already known all the charges against him. </seg>
<seg id=5> I think he will probably be found guilty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Ousted from office in early September, Anwar launched a series of reform demonstrations and was  arrested under the Internal Security Act on September 20th, charged with 10 crimes, including five crimes of sodomy as well as five crimes of corruption. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> On Tuesday Anwar made his debut after 9 days in detention, his left eye black and swollen, one arm bruised. He denied all the charges against him in court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Taiyimamu at present is attending an international alumni meeting in Adlade City. </seg>
<seg id=9> He said he didn't contact Anwar recently, but he didn't worry about Anwar's condition, nor did he worry that Anwar might not be tried justly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> He said, "law is fair ... if he is innocent, I believe he will be released. </seg>
<seg id=11> However, if he is found guilty, he should be punished like the other Malysian citizens." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Taiyimamu also attributed Malysia's recently tarnished international image to Anwar. </seg>
<seg id=13> He said, "I think what brings unfavorable impact on our image is not what happened here, but what Anwar said in public." </seg>
