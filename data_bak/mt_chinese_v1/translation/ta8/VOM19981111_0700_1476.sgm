<seg id=1> At Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina, the delegates for the United Nations Global Climate Conference continued to work. </seg>
<seg id=2> In the meantime, the US Congress was debating on whether or not to ratify the agreement reached at the Japan Kyoto Conference last year. </seg>
<seg id=3> According to another report by VOA reporter Flacus from Buenos Aires, several US Congressmen brought the debate over to the Conference Hall at Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id=4> Now please listen to the detailed contents of the report below, spoken by Macjill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Democratic Party Senators of the US Congress Lickman and Cree made a statement at Buenos Aires on Tuesday, urging the Clinton administration to ratify this week the agreement reached at the Kyoto Conference. </seg>
<seg id=6> The two senators manifested that this would strengthen the US delegates' persuaive force among the developing nations, so that they would more likely give concessions on the issue of reducing waste gas release concerning the green-house effect. </seg>
<seg id=7> This is actually the necessary condition stated in the several bills put forward by the Senate some time ago. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, some members of the House of Representatives of the US Congress at Buenos Aires said that they were against any such action taken by the Clinton administration. </seg>
<seg id=9> Sensenbrena, chairman of Science Committee of the House of Representatives, Republican M.H.R. of Wisconsin said that the Kyoto Conference agreement had a fatal flaw and that it would surely be denied by the US Senate. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> M.H.R. Sensenbrena said that the agreement was actually dead when it was sent to the Senate, just as it is now being suspended; and that the US Senate would not ratify it. </seg>
<seg id=12> The problem lies in what we can do now. </seg>
<seg id=13> Should we save it or announce that it has a fatal flaw and needs to be discussed again. </seg>
<seg id=14> Senator Sensenbrena indicated that this was nothing like the fight between the two parties in the US Senate and the House of Representatives, so did several other well-known Democratic Party senators. </seg>
<seg id=15> Clincker, member of the House of Representatives and Democratic Party member from Pennsylvania said that he was against this agreement because it would diminish the chances of employment and decrease the industrialization of the USA as he termed it. </seg>
<seg id=16> Kuchinchi, member of the House of Representatives and Democratic Party member from Ohio, however, disagreed with Sensenbrena, and he compared the fight agaist global warming to the fight for the world peace. </seg>
<seg id=17> He said that the same determination would ensure the victory of the Kyoto agreement. </seg>
<seg id=18> He said, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=19> Member of the House of Representative Kuchinchi said, I hope this procedure will go on, and at the same time we should not neglect the necessity of reaching a global solution agreement because of a certain Congressman's stubbornness, not even without the participation of the US Congress. </seg>
<seg id=20> At the main conference hall in Buenos Aires, the delegates were discussing various issues, some of which must be left for the energy and environment ministers of the 160 countries for the conference to resolve in the Wednesday meeting. </seg>
<seg id=21> The US delegate said that even though the issue that US is fairely concerned about would be put off to the next year's meeting to be resolved, this year's meeting had had a certain progress on the same issue. </seg>
