</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hudson Building was once the biggest retail store in the world and was also the symbol of Detroit City. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the explosion of the 1215-kilogram moulding dynamite, it eventually turned into a pile of 0.36 billion-kilogram debris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> at 5:45 P.M. local time, a series of inplosions took place in Hudson Building, the thick dust turning into huge smog which engulfed all of the bystanders. </seg>
<seg id=7> One citizen said, "we did not expect that we would become blackened all over by the dust." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> When the building collapsed, some bystanders cheered up, while others wiped the tears off their faces, for they won't be able see this familiar building any more. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=11> Alcher, mayor of Detroit, once announced to the public that the authority would give the chance of operating the igniter to the public, in order to raise US$150,000 charity donations. </seg>
<seg id=12> But since Hudson Building once was the glory of Detroit, no one would like to switch on the igniter to destroy the building by himself. </seg>

<seg id=13> A man who favoured to protect this building said, "This is something sad." </seg>
