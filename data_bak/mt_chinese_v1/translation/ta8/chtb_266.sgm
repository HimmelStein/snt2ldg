<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency. Jerusalem. Aug. 31. (Reporter Huai Chengbo) According to "Jerusalem Post Newspaper" which today quoted Savir, the Chairman of Israel Foreign Ministry General Office, World Bank had decided to offer, before the end of 1994, the Palestinian self-rule Authority aiding money of US$0.25 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This decision broke the impasse that lasted nearly a year between the aiding countries and the Palestinian self-rule Authority. </seg>
<seg id=4> On October 1 last year at the Washington-held international convention for helping Palestine exercise autonomy, the aiding countries promised to provide, within five years, development aiding money for US$2.4 billion, of which US$ 0.75 billion was committed to the first year. </seg>
<seg id=5> But the aiding countries claimed that the Palestinian autonomous region was short of necessary mechanism and accounts to deal with the aiding money, therefore refused to completely fulfill the promise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Savil said although US and World Bank were not satisfied with Palestinian accounting work, they still agreed to supply some of the money shortly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Arafat,the Chairman of PLO Executive Committee and other Palestinian leaders had always been criticizing the aiding countries' failure to carry out the promise and to make the aiding money completely in place on time. </seg>
<seg id=8> It is estimated that Shaarth, chief negotiation representative of PLO, and Rothchield, chief negotiation representative of Israel, will go to Washington to have a concrete talk with US and World Bank in the hope of finalizing the aiding money. </seg>
