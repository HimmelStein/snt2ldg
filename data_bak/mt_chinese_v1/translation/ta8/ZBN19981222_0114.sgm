<seg id=1> Philippines Condemns Malaysia's Attempt to Occupy Its Reef Beach </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Manila journalist Fei Nande reports </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Philippine officials believe that besides China another country that constitutes a potential threat to the Philippines at the Nansha Islands is Malaysia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A document of Philippine Military Intelligence Bureau indicates that Malaysian troops had once been attempting to occupy a reef beach that belongs to the Philippines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The paper said that Malaysia's action of attempting to occupy this Philippine reef might make a security problem to the Philippines because this reef beach geologically is close to Philippines' Barawan Island. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The document didn't say when this matter happened and didn't say why Malaysian troops' attempt was not successful either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Philippine military officials said, when receiving a reporter's interview earlier, that Malaysia's action of attempting to occupy this reef beach occurred in August or several months before the Philippines found Chinese Navy underwent activities at Meiji Reef in November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They explained that the Philippine Authorities' punctual "persuasion" stopped Malaysia from implementing its plans in this region, but Philippine Defence Ministry staff didn't tell the detailed story. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Before Philippine military revealed that Malaysia attempted to occupy the Philippine-belonging reef beach, President Estrada rejected the proposal raised by the military that the Philippine-belonging reef beach be controlled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> In the same report, the military claimed that China's construction of facilities at the Meiji Reef is a "springboard", which makes a preparation for China's final occupation of the nearby Lide Beach and oil exploration operation. </seg>
