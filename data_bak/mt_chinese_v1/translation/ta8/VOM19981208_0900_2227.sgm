<seg id=4> Sheng Huaren, the person in charge of the China National Economic and Trade Committee said that Chinese army would be completely seperated from the subordinate enterprises and companies before 20th, December. </seg>
<seg id=5> Other Party and Government departments as well as judicial departments must also take similiar measures from the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered that from July of this year, the army and the police troops would stop engaging in enterprises, hotels and other business facilities, in order to control the spreading corruption and smuggling within the army. </seg>
<seg id=7> Sheng Huaren said that, up to now, some subordinate enterprises in the armies in Shanghai and Tianjin had been transferred to be controlled by the local governments, but he didn't make it clear wether the army may be compensated for it. </seg>
<seg id=8> Besides that the army should hand over the control power of the subordinate enterprises, the Party and Government departments as well as judicial departments will no longer run the subordinate state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=9> There are more than 0.1 billion employees in China's state-owned enterprises. Many enterprises are actually on the edge of bankruptcy due to the slump export market caused by the serious bad debts , dead debts and global economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=10> Sheng Huaren said that the number of in-service employees in many state-owned enterprises is ten times more than actually needed, which worsened the deficit conditions in the enterprises in the past year. </seg>
<seg id=11> This indicates that it has become the most urgent task at present to strengthen the market competiveness of the state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=12> In addition, analysts said that there widely exist corruption and bad management in the government departments and Party and Judicial departmnets in charge of the state-owned enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=13> It is a most common thing that many governmental officials in charge of a certain trade are in charge of the operation of the enterprises of the same trade at the same time. </seg>
<seg id=14> So they can exercise their power to offer preferences in contracts, loans and taxation to these enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=15> This phenomenon has destroyed equal market competitions, thus obstructing China from plan economy to free market economy. </seg>
<seg id=16> In terms of an investigation, more than 500 biggest state-owned enterprises under the Party and Government departments as well as judicial departments will be supervised and managed by a newly-founded committee in the State Council. And the employees in these enterprises will be arranged by the personnel departments. </seg>
<seg id=17> Those smaller-scale enterprises will be managed by the local governments. </seg>
<seg id=18> In addition, the financial and investment companies will be managed unitarily by the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id=19> At present, it is still unkown whether these transformations may indicate that the country will reduce its loans to the state-owned enterprises, and make some large-scale enterprises bankrupt gradually. </seg>
<seg id=20> Some analysts thought that, for fear that the high unemplyment rate might cause social turbulance, China might settle the deficit problems in the state-owned enterprises mainly by merging, not by bankruptcy. </seg>
