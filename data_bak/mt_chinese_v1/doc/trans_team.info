Machine Translation System Information

Sys.ID	System Information 	Translation Procedure

tb1	Commercial software	Built-in batch translation was used.  Unrecognized
				Chinese words are preserved in the output.  Thus output
				is a mix of plain ASCII and GB.

tb2	Commercial software	Built-in drag-and-drop file translation option was
				used.  Unrecognized Chinese words are preserved in the
				output.  The output is in Unicode. For conversion to ANSI
				code, each output file was opened in Notepad and saved
				as ANSI.  Some files had gibberish symbols in the Unicode
				output and did not make sense either in the ANSI
				version.

tb3	Commercial software	To preserve the original like breaks - which it doesn't
				in normal file translation, each source file was opened
				in a web browser.  The output was then copied into a
				Notepad buffer and then saved as a text file in ANSI.
				The output encoding is also in Unicode and some output
				files also have gibberish symbols.  For almost every
				sentence translated, the system provided an alternative
				translation, which was always removed in the final
				output.

tb4	Commercial software	A 16-bit application that only runs on Win9x/Win3.x
				systems and does not handle long file names.  It also
				crashes on certain input for no apparent reason -
				when this happened, the corresponding output segment
				was left empty.  All output was saved in a temporary
				file and renamed as the original.

tb5	Web-based free service	Web transltion option was used.  The source files
				were placed temporarily on a web server and the link
				to each invididual file was given to the system for
				translation.  The output was then copied to a
				Notepad window and saved using the original file
				name.  The output did not have line breaks - they
				were manually inserted in correspondence with the
				source.

tb6	Web-based free service	The simple procedure of copying, pasting and saving
				was used.  The content of each source file was copied
				into the source box for translation.  The content of the
				target box was copied to a Notepad buffer.  Words not
				translated could not display properly in the output box,
				which seems to indicate Unicode encoding used by the
				system.  Some gibberish symbols remain in the output.
